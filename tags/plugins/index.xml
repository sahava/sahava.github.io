I should really stop throwing the word &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; around, since people always tell me that the stuff I claim to be easy and straightforward is rarely so. But since this is my blog, I reserve the right to use whatever stupid and misleading terminology I want. I maintain that what follows IS quite simple, especially when considering the amount of complexity it reduces in your &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Universal Analytics&lt;/a> setup.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Universal Analytics Plugins Explained</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/universal-analytics-plugins-explained/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2015 13:21:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/universal-analytics-plugins-explained/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are many tools and methods to make &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics&lt;/a> more manageable. &lt;a href="http://tagmanager.google.com">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> is probably the best known of these, and you can find many, many &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/tags/google-tag-manager/">articles about GTM&lt;/a> on these pages as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, today I want to tell you about one of the features of Universal Analytics that hasn&amp;rsquo;t, as far as I know, received too much attention. It&amp;rsquo;s funny, because at the same time almost everyone uses the feature in the shape of &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/ecommerce">eCommerce&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2558867?hl=en">enhanced link attribution&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cross-domain#autolink">cross-domain tracking&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;m talking, of course, about &lt;strong>Universal Analytics plugins&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
