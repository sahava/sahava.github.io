      <description>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve last written a bona fide Google Tag Manager trick, so here comes. This was inspired by Bart Gibby&#39;s question in Measure Slack.
The purpose is to fetch the latest currency exchange rates from the exchangeratesapi.io service, cache them using sessionStorage, and push the results into dataLayer. From dataLayer, they can then be utilized in Custom JavaScript variables and custom variable templates to perform client-side conversions.</description>

      <title>#GTMTips: Tag Sequencing With Custom HTML Tags</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/tag-sequencing-custom-html-tags/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/tag-sequencing-custom-html-tags/</guid>
      <description>Tag sequencing was introdced to Google Tag Manager in late 2015. Its main purpose was to facilitate the sequential firing of tags that have dependencies with each other. Due to the asynchronous nature of third-party libraries like Google Tag Manager, it&#39;s difficult to establish an order of completion with tags that compete for their chance to fire.
Tag sequencing changed this, as it allows you to establish setup and cleanup tags - the former firing before the main tag, and the latter after.</description>

      <description>What better way to celebrate the 50th #GTMTips article than, well, a really useful Google Tag Manager tip?! This tip is so useful and simple; it encapsulates everything that I had in mind when starting this series. The tip is about restricting scope of Custom HTML Tags. This is an important concept, because it&#39;s possible that you&#39;re stuffing your page&#39;s global JavaScript namespace with all sorts of junk, and thus inadvertently causing conflicts.</description>

      <description>This article is a guest article by someone from the analytics community I really look up to. Dan Wilkerson is an analytics developer at Bounteous, a company I hold in high esteem. Dan is one of the smartest technical analytics experts out there, and a large bulk of the awesome scripts and hacks that Bounteous produces (almost on a daily basis) have been orchestrated by him. So I&#39;m very pleased to give the floor to Dan, so that he can tell you all about using the pesky document.</description>

      <title>Track Form Abandonment With Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-form-abandonment-with-google-tag-manager/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-form-abandonment-with-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>Form abandonment isn&#39;t always easy to define. Most often, it refers to when someone starts to fill in an HTML form, but leaves the page without submitting it. As a definition, this works nicely. However, with multi-page forms it naturally refers only to the last page of the form. Also, especially with government institutions, forms can be saved to be submitted later. Here, again, form abandonment must be reconsidered.
  In this article, I&#39;ll go over four different ways to track form abandonment in Google Analytics, using Google Tag Manager to setup the tracking.</description>

      <title>Access The Tracker Object In Your Page View Tag</title>

      <description>If you read my previous post on fetching the Client ID from the Universal Analytics tracker object with Google Tag Manager, you might have agreed with me that it sucks you can&#39;t access the tracker object interface in real time using Google Tag Manager. This is because all of the set commands you add to a Universal Analytics tag template take place before the analytics.js is loaded and the tracker object is properly created.</description>

      <title>Simple Split Test With Google Tag Manager</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/simple-split-test-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>Over the last couple of posts I&#39;ve mainly been doing proof-of-concept (POC) tests with Google Tag Manager. The great thing about a POC is that you don&#39;t really need to have any viable results or insight-driving technological innovations. The point is to showcase some feature of the platform on which the experiment was conducted.
In this post, I&#39;ll take a care-free step into the world of POCs again. My goal is to do a simple split test in order to identify which variant of a landing page (or key element thereof) produces the most conversions.</description>

      <title>Block Internal Traffic With Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/block-internal-traffic-gtm/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/block-internal-traffic-gtm/</guid>
      <description>You&#39;ve probably come across a number of guides or posts talking about why it&#39;s necessary to block so-called internal traffic from your web analytics reports. The reasons are pretty solid: internal traffic does not emulate normal visitor behavior, it rarely contributes to conversions (skewing up your conversion rate), it inflates page views, and it wreaks havoc on your granular, page-by-page data.
Internal traffic is vaguely described as &amp;ldquo;your employees&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;people really close to your brand&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;your marketing department&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;your web editors&amp;rdquo;, and so on.</description>

      <title>Google Tag Manager: Content Grouping</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-tag-manager-content-grouping/</guid>
      <description>Content Grouping is a nice new feature from the good folks at Google Analytics. Basically, it allows you to group your content according to a logical structure. You can create up to five Content Groupings, and you can have as many Content Groups within these groupings as you like. The difference between a Content Grouping and Content Group is hierarchy. The second is a member of the first. Read Justin Cutroni&#39;s post on Content Groupings to get you started.</description>

      <title>Google Tag Manager: Track Social Interactions</title>

      <description>(Last updated June 2014) Google Analytics provides us with a nifty way of tracking social interactions. With a simple plugin, you can track how many +1s and Likes your pages accumulate.
This guide shows you how to activate social interaction tagging with Google Tag Manager and Universal Analytics. The instructions are for Facebook Likes, Google+ +1s (now deprecated since Google Analytics tracks +1s automatically), Twitter Tweets and Pinterest Pins.
Note that if you use a third-party API (e.</description>

      <title>Track Adjusted Bounce Rate In Universal Analytics</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-adjusted-bounce-rate-universal-analytics/</guid>
      <description>So here we are again. Universal Analytics and Google Tag Manager, the dynamic duo, ready to strike again.
First, remember to check my previous two tips for UA and GTM use in custom scenarios:
 Weather as a custom dimension Tracking page load time  In this post, I visit the idea of adjusted bounce rate, which I came across a year ago in the Google Analytics blog.
Adjusted bounce rate basically refers to tweaking the traditional bounce rate collection method (single engagement hits / total visits) so that visits which only included a single page view would not count towards a bounce, as long as they met some qualitative requirements.</description>

      <title>Page Load Time In Universal Analytics</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/page-load-time-universal-analytics/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/page-load-time-universal-analytics/</guid>
      <description>In Google Analytics, you can monitor your site speed and get a decent overview of what pages are contributing positively and negatively to site speed. The problem with page load time metric is that it&#39;s an average based on a sample. You can modify the sample rate with setSiteSpeedSampleRate(), but for me that&#39;s not bloody well good enough.
(UPDATE 28.3.2014: This post is still valid, but an implementation with User Timings is a much smarter way to measure actual page load time.</description>

      <description>There is a new version of this post for GTM V2 here.
[Last updated June 2014] I&#39;ve fallen in love with Universal Analytics and Google Tag Manager. Together they form an incredibly powerful tool for marketing professionals. In most cases, I no longer need to post recommendations to my client for yet another page template revision, since with the tag manager in place, I can just add custom code via the admin panel.</description>
