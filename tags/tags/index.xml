      <description>Because I was bored, I did a quick test to sort out the firing order of competing GTM listeners. If you&amp;rsquo;ve done your homework (i.e. read my article on GTM listeners), you&amp;rsquo;ll remember that GTM listeners are set up on the document node of the document object model (DOM). I wanted to test what the firing order is if you have multiple competing listeners on the same page.
I tested with the following listeners (make sure you read up on auto-event tracking if you are completely baffled at this point):</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new listener in town! It&amp;rsquo;s a few days now since the Google Tag Manager team unleashed the History Listener, and the time has come for me to tell you what this baby can do.
The History Listener is designed to be used on websites where content is loaded dynamically. Typically, these websites make heavy use of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), which is designed for loading content in the background and serving it dynamically without having to reload the page.</description>

      <description>When push comes to shove, I&amp;rsquo;m a pretty lazy guy. I enjoy nothing more than just to stretch my legs on a couch, pick up my iPad, and read what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the world. I skip the news, since they&amp;rsquo;re just full of depressing stories. Instead, I head over to my favorite Google+ communities to see what&amp;rsquo;s new in the blogosphere.
  This approach has led me to some pretty amazing individuals, whom I follow like a suckerfish.</description>

      <description>There is a new version of this post for GTM V2 here.
The Google Analytics Summit came and went, and thanks to the Live Stream, everyone could participate. We were treated to a rapid-fire selection of Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; new features, and this post sheds light on one of these in particular: automated event tracking in Google Tag Manager.
Auto-event tracking introduces a nice feature, which does what tag managers ought to do: it provides functionality without HTML template editing.</description>
