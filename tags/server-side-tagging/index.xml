      <title>#GTMTips: Prevent SGTM From Setting The FPID Cookie</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/prevent-sgtm-from-setting-fpid-cookie/</link>

      <description>The FPID cookie is what server-side Google Tag Manager would prefer to use for your Google Analytics 4 tracking.
It&amp;rsquo;s a cookie set in the HTTP response from the server, and it&amp;rsquo;s flagged as HttpOnly, which means it&amp;rsquo;s only accessible by a web server running on the domain on which it was set.
There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with the technology, and I do recommend that server-side setups toggle it on by default.</description>

      <description>Server-side tagging is all about control. Being able to intercept, modify, and even block requests as they come in before they are dispatched to their actual endpoints is extremely valuable.
The built-in Google Analytics 4 tag template has options for modifying event parameters and user properties in the Google Analytics 4 request, but did you know you can use these options to modify some of the fields as well, such as Client ID, User ID, and event Engagement Time?</description>

      <title>Agency, Transparency, And Control: Unsolved Problems With Server-side Tagging</title>

      <description>I have been a strong supporter of server-side tagging, in particular Google&amp;rsquo;s server-side tag management solution.
I admire the way it seeks to readjust the balance of control that typically has been in favor of the marketing vendors whose JavaScript libraries have been free to wreak havoc in the user&amp;rsquo;s browser.
  By inserting a buffer between the user and the vendor, the owner of the server-side tagging setup can take control over what data the marketing vendors can actually process of the user.</description>

      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/preflight-requests-in-server-side-google-tag-manager/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/preflight-requests-in-server-side-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>With certain types of HTTP requests, the web browser might first dispatch a request with the OPTIONS method, also known as a preflight request.
The purpose of the preflight request is to &amp;ldquo;check&amp;rdquo; with the web server that it&amp;rsquo;s equipped to handle the type of cross-origin request the browser wants to dispatch.
If the server doesn&amp;rsquo;t handle this preflight request, or if it returns a response that doesn&amp;rsquo;t agree with what the web browser wants to actually dispatch, the check fails and the browser refuses to send the actual request.</description>

      <description>Server-side Google Tag Manager has an excellent Preview mode, which lets you inspect incoming requests, monitor the event data object, view console messages, and identify outgoing requests, among other things.
To enable this Preview mode on the web, you simply need to click the Preview button in the container, after which any requests sent from the same browser instance will be automatically shown in the Preview mode window.
However, what about if you want to send requests from another browser?</description>

      <description>If you want to manually install server-side Google Tag Manager on App Engine in the Google Cloud Platform, you are of course welcome to do so.
The main benefits of doing this are that you get to choose the region where App Engine is deployed and that you can use existing project resources instead of having a new project automatically created for you.
However, to run the script without errors, there are a number of things you need to enable first.</description>

      <description>With asynchronous variables recently released in server-side Google Tag Manager, it&amp;rsquo;s time to dig into data enrichment flows using another release from the Google team.
* drum roll *
We have a new Google Cloud Platform API!
It&amp;rsquo;s fast. It&amp;rsquo;s sleek. It&amp;rsquo;s beautiful. It&amp;rsquo;s Firestore!
  Firestore is a NoSQL, transactional, and scalable database that offers near-real-time write/read and sync operations for data.
In practice, it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to enrich and widen the data that you pass through your Server container.</description>

      <description>OK, that&amp;rsquo;s one unappealing title for a blog post, but rest assured that the content more than makes up for this obscurity.
Recently, my favorite toy in the world, Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s server container, introduced the capability to handle asynchronous operations in variables.
This is done through a JavaScript interface known as Promise. A Promise is a way to run code in JavaScript without knowing what its eventual value will be.</description>

      <description>While Google App Engine, the default implementation pattern of server-side Google Tag Manager, is straightforward to setup with the automatic provisioning steps, it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not the only way to deploy the server.
 You can set it up in Amazon AWS (this blog) You can set it up in Microsoft Azure (this blog) You can set it up with Cloud Run (Mark Edmondson&amp;rsquo;s blog)  In fact, the manual setup guide gives you the details on how to deploy a Google Tag Manager Server in any environment that runs Docker.</description>

      <description>Although most of Server-side Tagging in Google Tag Manager revolves, quite rightfully, around Clients, there&amp;rsquo;s still plenty of value to be derived from tags, too.
Naturally, the most common use case for server-side tags is to map the incoming requests to the Server container (filtered through Clients) and dispatch them to their respective endpoints.
But in addition to dispatching HTTP requests, tags can do so much more.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll share with you a neat way how to utilize tags to manipulate the HTTP responses the Server container sends back to the request source.</description>

      <description>To continue my extensive collection of Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s server-side tagging articles, in this guide I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through how to set up a Server container in Microsoft Azure&amp;rsquo;s App Service platform.
For my previous guides on manually provisioning a Server container, follow these links:
 Amazon AWS (Elastic Beanstalk): Deploy Server-side Google Tag Manager In AWS Google Cloud (App Engine): Provision Server-side Tagging Application Manually  Azure&amp;rsquo;s App Service is similar to AWS Elastic Beanstalk and GCP App Engine, in that it lets you create a web application from scratch with minimal effort.</description>

      <title>Measure Ad Blocker Impact With Server-side GTM</title>

      <description>For many, it seems, one of the most important justifications for server-side Google Tag Manager is its resilience to ad and content blockers. After all, by virtue of serving the container JavaScript from your own domain, you escape many of the heuristic devices today&amp;rsquo;s blocker technologies employ.
Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone on record over and over again to say how this is poor justification for using server-side GTM. By circumventing the user&amp;rsquo;s wish to block scripts, you are disrespecting them and forcing their browser to download scripts that they wanted to avoid downloading in the first place.</description>

      <description>Google has released the Google Ads Remarketing tag for server-side tagging in Google Tag Manager.
Functionally, it&amp;rsquo;s remarkably similar to the Conversion Tracking tag they released previously. In fact, you should go ahead and read that article first, so that you have an understanding of how Google Ads tracking works through Server containers!
Follow this link to read the official documentation.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through how to set things up, and I&amp;rsquo;ll also provide an overview of how it works.</description>

      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/cross-domain-tracking-server-side-fpid-cookie/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/cross-domain-tracking-server-side-fpid-cookie/</guid>
      <description>The FPID cookie in server-side tagging for Google Tag Manager is an HttpOnly, server-managed ID cookie that&amp;rsquo;s designed to replace the JavaScript-managed _ga cookie used by Google Analytics 4 and Universal Analytics.
For more details about the cookie itself, check out my previous article on FPID.
In that article, I mentioned one caveat for adopting FPID being the fact that cross-domain tracking will not work.
I mean, how could it? FPID is an HttpOnly cookie, which means it&amp;rsquo;s not available to JavaScript in the browser.</description>

      <description>One of the biggest blockers for Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s server-side tagging to slip out of beta is Google Ads. Until server-side tagging supports a solution for both conversions and remarketing capabilities to be reproduced server-side, it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely that Server containers will lose their beta label.
  While I can&amp;rsquo;t say what will happen to the beta label now, the fact is that Google Tag Manager has now released support for Conversion tracking using server-side tagging.</description>

      <description>Since Google Tag Manager released the manual setup guide for server-side tagging, my mind has been spinning with the idea of walking through the deployment into Amazon&amp;rsquo;s AWS.
I personally prefer Google Cloud Platform over AWS, because I think it&amp;rsquo;s so much more user-friendly. Even though in this guide we&amp;rsquo;ll be utilizing one of the simplest AWS services, Elastic Beanstalk, the deployment is still much more complex than if you were to use GCP&amp;rsquo;s App Engine.</description>

      <description>Last updated: 18 October 2021. Peview works now with the proxied container even if the container ID is overridden..
 While server-side tagging already has a wonderful built-in Client for proxying the Google Tag Manager container via your own first-party domain, it&amp;rsquo;s not perfect.
The main issues are that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t let you delimit access on a per-origin basis, so requests for the allowlisted container IDs can be sent from anywhere, and that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t let you freely choose the path via which the container ID is loaded.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written about Google&amp;rsquo;s reCAPTCHA v3 before. It&amp;rsquo;s a verification API, which analyzes the signals fed into it and returns a bot score, based on how &amp;ldquo;bot-like&amp;rdquo; the hits are.
It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to validate whether or not to collect data from certain sources that exhibit bot-like behavior. You&amp;rsquo;ll want to ignore those in your analytics tools, for example, as they tend to add a lot of (unrealistic) noise to the data set.</description>

      <description>The automatic provisioning process of the Google Tag Manager server-side tagging service is extremely useful.
With just a few clicks of the button, you can have a fully functional (albeit limited to testing use) server-side tagging endpoint on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
 For a video overview of the automatic deployment, see this video.
 However, the automatic provisioning process creates a new Google Cloud Platform project and, at the time of writing, always deploys the App Engine application (on which the tagging server runs) in the us-central-1 GCP region.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/url-parser-variable-template-server-containers/</guid>
      <description>With server-side tagging, you can send any types of HTTP requests to the Server container. The Server container parses these, fires up container instances, and sends the data onwards to first-party data stores and third-party vendors alike.
Often these requests contain URL strings encoded in query parameters. A prime example is the document location parameter in Universal Analytics requests.
Server-side Clients would parse these URL strings and convert them into the format required by the event data object.</description>

      <description>Facebook has now officially released their Conversions API tag template for server-side tagging in Google Tag Manager.
With this tag template, you can create a server-side tag that fires with any Client designed to parse requests into a unified event model.
  One such Client already exists, and every single Server container has it built-in: the GA4 Client.
 If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet deployed a Server container, check out this video walkthrough for more details on how to do it.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/map-multiple-domains-server-side-tagging-endpoint/</guid>
      <description>One of the biggest perks of working with server-side tagging is that you can establish a first-party context between the site sending the data and the server-side tagging endpoint itself.
This leads to many benefits, including improved control of the data streams, the possibility to set cookies that extend beyond ITP&amp;rsquo;s restrictions, and reduced stress on an already very likely overloaded Content Security Policy.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to map multiple custom domains to your Google Cloud Project application.</description>

      <description>Ever since it was released that server-side tagging in Google Tag Manager would run on the Google Cloud Platform stack, my imagination has been running wild.
By running on GCP, the potential for integrations with other GCP components is limitless. The output to Cloud Logging already introduces interesting pipeline opportunities, but now it gets even better.
It&amp;rsquo;s finally possible to write directly to Google BigQuery from a Client or tag template!</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/tips-for-logging-server-side-tagging/</guid>
      <description>One of the largest costs in a server-side tagging can be logging. Google warns about this in their official documentation, and it&amp;rsquo;s definitely something to keep a keen eye on if your server-side endpoint processes enough data per month.
How much should it process for logging to become an issue? It depends, but you could start seeing some impact once the endpoint processes &amp;gt;1 million incoming requests per month. The best way to find out if logging is a problem is to visit the Billing dashboard in your server-side tagging Google Cloud project and check what the portion of Log Volume is in your monthly costs.</description>

      <description>With the introduction of server-side tagging in Google Tag Manager, the variety of things you can do with your own server-side proxy is mind-boggling:
 Reduce client-side bloat by consolidating data streams and distributing them to vendor endpoints server-side. Improve data security by adding safeguards and validations to prevent harmful data from being sent to vendor endpoints. Enrich data server-side, by combining the incoming data stream with data from APIs and data stores that you own and control.</description>

      <description>When you create a Server container in Google Tag Manager, GTM creates an App Engine deployment in the Google Cloud Platform for you.
App Engine is a managed serverless platform, which basically means it&amp;rsquo;s a (set of) virtual machine(s) running in the cloud, with some extra bells and whistles added to make managing it easier.
A potentially useful thing that App Engine does is decorate all incoming HTTP requests with some HTTP headers that can be used in the app.</description>

      <description>Since the release of Server-side tagging in Google Tag Manager, I&amp;rsquo;ve jumped at every opportunity to celebrate the tools it provides for improving end-user privacy and data security.
One of the biggest benefits is obfuscation-by-default. Since all hits are passed through the server-side proxy, the default view for any third-party tool (such as Google Analytics) is that of the server in the Google Cloud rather than the browser and device with which the user was browsing the site.</description>

      <description>Last updated 27 April 2023 with details about preventing FPID access in cookieless scenarios.
 With Server-side tagging, the developer community has a chance to vastly improve the data collection capabilities of Google&amp;rsquo;s analytics platforms (Universal Analytics and App+Web). The ability to build our own templates is particularly potent with a Server container.
However, it&amp;rsquo;s not as if Google themselves are just sitting idly by and seeing what the community can come up with.</description>

      <title>#GTMTips: Build A Custom Universal Analytics Client For Server-side Tagging</title>

      <description>You can utilize Server-side tagging in Google Tag Manager to build your own custom Universal Analytics proxy.
This proxy comes in the shape of a new Client custom template, which takes the incoming /collect requests and sends them to Google Analytics. While doing so, it also returns the _ga cookie in a Set-Cookie header, thus preventing Safari&amp;rsquo;s Intelligent Tracking Prevention from capping its expiration to just 7 days.

      <description>When you use Google Analytics on the web, you are most likely implementing one of analytics.js, the global site tag (gtag.js), or Universal Analytics tags via Google Tag Manager.
These libraries all end up doing the same thing: compiling a payload-rich HTTP request to an endpoint at https://www.google-analytics.com.
What if you want to have the JavaScript libraries do their job, but instead of sending the data to Google&amp;rsquo;s servers, you send them to a new, custom endpoint?</description>

      <description>Ever since Server-side tagging was publicly announced at SUPERWEEK 2020, Google and the trusted tester community have been hard at work, building something that just might change the landscape of digital analytics for good.
Google Tag Manager has now released Server-side tagging into public beta. In this lengthy article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at what Server-side tagging is, how it should (and should not) be used, and what its implications are on the broader digital analytics community.</description>
