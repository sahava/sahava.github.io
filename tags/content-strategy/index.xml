Oh yes! And to make matters worse, I&amp;rsquo;m actually calling this &lt;em>SEO In A Nutshell&lt;/em> just out of spite! But why, oh why, must I litter the otherwise so clean and orderly forum that Internet is with yet another here&amp;rsquo;s-what-something-is-in-case-you-ever-cared-post? I promise, I&amp;rsquo;m only doing this for selfish reasons. I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to buy myself into the major league by posting about something that everyone else is posting about. I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to impress those whom I work with by telling them I&amp;rsquo;m good at something I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be good at. And I&amp;rsquo;m definitely not trying to impress you, my cynical reader, since I know you are so difficult to please.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Content Strategy: Know Your Audience</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/seo/content-strategy-know-your-audience/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2013 05:54:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/seo/content-strategy-know-your-audience/</guid><description>&lt;p>For years and years, the one constant in the chaotic world of SEO has been a simple statement: Content is King. This statement has been the cornerstone of content strategy in SEO projects, and its validity has hardly been contested. This is not due to lack of trying. Many posts in the blogosphere have taken an opposing stand (Heidi Cohen: &lt;a href="http://heidicohen.com/blogging-content-is-not-king/">format is king&lt;/a>, Carl Ocab: &lt;a href="http://www.carlocab.com/i-have-a-secret-content-is-not-king/">marketing is king&lt;/a>, Bernadette Coleman: &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/content-isnt-king-trust-is-king">trust is king&lt;/a>). The message of the opposition is this: content cannot be king, as it is only a small part of the audience experience.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
