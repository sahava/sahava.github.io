      <title>Google Analytics 4: Ecommerce Guide For Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-analytics-4-ecommerce-guide-google-tag-manager/</link>

      <description>This is an implementation guide for Google Analytics 4. The guide is aimed at Google Tag Manager users and has been designed to complement the official documentation.
  A thing to keep in mind is that Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is still very new. The Google Tag Manager integration is still in its infancy, and implementation places a lot of responsibility on accurate tagging and proper dataLayer instrumentation.
In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain the new data model from an implementation perspective, and walk you through the nuts and bolts on how to get the different parts of GA4&amp;rsquo;s Ecommerce machine to work in unison.</description>

      <title>Prevent Duplicate Transactions In Google Analytics With customTask</title>

      <description>One of the big problems in Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; data model is the immutability of historical data. Once a row of data is written into the data table, it is there practically for good. This is especially annoying in two cases: spam and bogus ecommerce hits. The first is a recognized issue with an open and public data collection protocol, the latter is an annoyance that can explode into full-blown sabotage (you can use the Measurement Protocol to send hundreds of huge transactions to your competitor&amp;rsquo;s GA property, for example).</description>

      <title>#GTMTips: Referral Exclusion On Receipt Page</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/referral-exclusion-on-receipt-page/</link>

      <description>You might have noticed that the Referral Exclusion List in Google Analytics is difficult to maintain. You can&amp;rsquo;t copy a list from one property to another, the list is a wildcard match for domain names (so all subdomains are automatically excluded), and it&amp;rsquo;s just about the clunkiest user interface we&amp;rsquo;ve seen since ERP tools from the 1990s. A while ago, I wrote of a solution which lets you manage referral exclusions using Google Tag Manager, and it&amp;rsquo;s still a neat trick, as it&amp;rsquo;s way more flexible than said clunky UI.</description>

      <description>My fingers have been tingling to write this article. Ever since I implemented Enhanced Ecommerce on my blog a couple of weeks ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting such an impressive amount of useful data that it&amp;rsquo;s mind-boggling.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the steps I went to implement the solution, along with examples of the data I can now access through Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; reporting interface. As you might have guessed, if you&amp;rsquo;ve read my articles before, I implemented Enhanced Ecommerce with Google Tag Manager.</description>

      <title>#GTMTips: Prevent Repeat Transactions</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/prevent-repeat-transactions/</link>

      <description>In this tip, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at how to leverage a custom first-party cookie to prevent repeat hits of any kind. This is most useful for transactions, since a common problem with Google Analytics (traditional) eCommerce tracking is that a transaction hit is sent again upon subsequent entries to the receipt page, for example using the Back button of the browser. In some cases, and this is not a good practice, a receipt e-mail is sent to the user with a link back to the receipt page, where the transaction is sent over and over again upon entry.</description>

      <title>eCommerce Tips For Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/ecommerce-tips-google-tag-manager/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that setting up eCommerce in Google Tag Manager (and now the new Enhanced ecommerce) is very difficult for many. I&amp;rsquo;m sure part of the problem is that eCommerce is for many users the moment that GTM forces you to take steps in to the developer&amp;rsquo;s domain, since it&amp;rsquo;s obvious that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to add some code to the web page.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t a tutorial on how to do eCommerce in Google Tag Manager.</description>
