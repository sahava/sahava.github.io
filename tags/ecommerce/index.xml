      <title>Prevent Duplicate Transactions In Google Analytics With customTask</title>

      <description>One of the big problems in Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; data model is the immutability of historical data. Once a row of data is written into the data table, it is there practically for good. This is especially annoying in two cases: spam and bogus ecommerce hits. The first is a recognized issue with an open and public data collection protocol, the latter is an annoyance that can explode into full-blown sabotage (you can use the Measurement Protocol to send hundreds of huge transactions to your competitor&#39;s GA property, for example).</description>

      <title>#GTMTips: Referral Exclusion On Receipt Page</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/referral-exclusion-on-receipt-page/</link>

      <description>You might have noticed that the Referral Exclusion List in Google Analytics is difficult to maintain. You can&#39;t copy a list from one property to another, the list is a wildcard match for domain names (so all subdomains are automatically excluded), and it&#39;s just about the clunkiest user interface we&#39;ve seen since ERP tools from the 1990s. A while ago, I wrote of a solution which lets you manage referral exclusions using Google Tag Manager, and it&#39;s still a neat trick, as it&#39;s way more flexible than said clunky UI.</description>

      <description>My fingers have been tingling to write this article. Ever since I implemented Enhanced Ecommerce on my blog a couple of weeks ago, I&#39;ve been getting such an impressive amount of useful data that it&#39;s mind-boggling.
In this article, I&#39;ll walk you through the steps I went to implement the solution, along with examples of the data I can now access through Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; reporting interface. As you might have guessed, if you&#39;ve read my articles before, I implemented Enhanced Ecommerce with Google Tag Manager.</description>

      <title>#GTMTips: Prevent Repeat Transactions</title>

      <description>In this tip, we&#39;ll take a look at how to leverage a custom first-party cookie to prevent repeat hits of any kind. This is most useful for transactions, since a common problem with Google Analytics (traditional) eCommerce tracking is that a transaction hit is sent again upon subsequent entries to the receipt page, for example using the Back button of the browser. In some cases, and this is not a good practice, a receipt e-mail is sent to the user with a link back to the receipt page, where the transaction is sent over and over again upon entry.</description>

      <title>eCommerce Tips For Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/ecommerce-tips-google-tag-manager/</link>

      <description>I&#39;ve noticed that setting up eCommerce in Google Tag Manager (and now the new Enhanced ecommerce) is very difficult for many. I&#39;m sure part of the problem is that eCommerce is for many users the moment that GTM forces you to take steps in to the developer&#39;s domain, since it&#39;s obvious that you&#39;ll need to add some code to the web page.
This isn&#39;t a tutorial on how to do eCommerce in Google Tag Manager.</description>
