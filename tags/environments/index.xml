There are many features still lacking, most of which have to do with working in multi-user environments. Now, grab the last word of that sentence (see what I did there), and hug it tightly, for GTM just introduced a new, enterprise-friendly feature: &lt;strong>Environments&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These &lt;em>Environments&lt;/em> are actually browser cookies, which you use to link a Google Tag Manager container &lt;strong>state&lt;/strong> with the browser of the user who needs to or wants to view that particular state. In other words, if you have a QA (quality assurance) process, as you should have, or if you do most of your testing on a staging server, as you should do, you can create an &lt;em>Environment&lt;/em> in GTM, after which you can publish container versions (even the draft) into that particular Environment alone.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
