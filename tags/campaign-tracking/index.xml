      <description>In Google Analytics for iOS, there are two types of campaign measurement. There&amp;rsquo;s install campaign measurement, which lets you track the channels which brought your visitors to the App Store, where they proceeded to download your app. There&amp;rsquo;s also launch campaign tracking, which lets you attribute app launches to specific campaigns.
In this tip post, we&amp;rsquo;ll tackle the latter. We&amp;rsquo;ll leverage a feature of the Google Analytics iOS SDK to build the parameters, and then push them to dataLayer so that they can be used in the Tag.</description>
