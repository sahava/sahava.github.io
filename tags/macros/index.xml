&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://analytics.blogspot.fi/2014/10/making-tag-management-more-accessible.html">current version&lt;/a> of &lt;a href="http://tagmanager.google.com">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> was released in October 2014. With the release, we saw a brand-spanking new UI, a lot of new functionalities (revamped &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/auto-event-tracking-gtm-2-0/">auto-event tracking&lt;/a>, for example), plus a new terminology to cope with. We moved away from the programming-centric concepts of &lt;em>Macros&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Rules&lt;/em> to the more tactile &lt;em>variables&lt;/em> and &lt;em>triggers&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to rank the changes. The new &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/auto-event-tracking-gtm-2-0/">Auto-Event Tracking&lt;/a> is perhaps most impactful, but the improvements done to triggers and variables, when compared to the previous version of GTM, require attention as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#GTMtips: Chain Macros In Lookup Tables</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/chain-macros-lookup-tables/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2014 10:05:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/chain-macros-lookup-tables/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the cool things about using a tag management solution is that you can leverage &lt;em>variables&lt;/em> like never before. In Google Tag Manager, these variables are referred to as macros, and you can identify a macro with the syntax of &lt;strong>{{macro name}}&lt;/strong>. In this tip I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you can actually call macros from other macros, using a Lookup Table as an example.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>


&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not just Lookup Tables, either. You can pretty much use a macro in any field where there is a script context (because macros are JavaScript functions and require a script context to be run). Valid fields are, for example, Custom HTML Tags, Custom JavaScript Macros, Google Analytics tag fields, and so on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fun With Google Tag Manager: Part 1</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/fun-with-google-tag-manager-part-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2014 13:58:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/fun-with-google-tag-manager-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s time to dig into my tip library for some pretty cool things you can do with &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/tagmanager">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> to enhance your site tagging.

&lt;p>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll take a care-free step into the world of POCs again.

&lt;p>I really enjoy the ad hoc Q&amp;amp;A sessions my blog posts have inspired. I haven&amp;rsquo;t said this enough, but I am really, REALLY grateful to people who take their time to comment on my posts, even if it&amp;rsquo;s just say a quick &amp;ldquo;Hi!&amp;rdquo;. The main reason I enjoy getting blog comments is because they often turn into blog posts. Seriously, if you&amp;rsquo;re a blogger suffering from writer&amp;rsquo;s block, take a look at your comments.

The reasons are pretty solid: internal traffic does not emulate normal visitor behavior, it rarely contributes to conversions (skewing up your conversion rate), it inflates page views, and it wreaks havoc on your granular, page-by-page data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Internal traffic is vaguely described as &amp;ldquo;your employees&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;people really close to your brand&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;your marketing department&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;your web editors&amp;rdquo;, and so on. Basically, it should be a term which covers &lt;em>traffic that does not adequately represent trending visitor behavior on your site&lt;/em>. Most often, this is &amp;ldquo;internal&amp;rdquo;, in that it is traffic by people who generate the content. It can also be your proof-readers (wives, husbands, best friends), beta testers (wives, husbands, best friends), outreach marketers (wives, husb&amp;hellip; you get my drift).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some Awesome Google Tag Manager Resources</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/awesome-google-tag-manager-resources/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2014 15:06:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/awesome-google-tag-manager-resources/</guid><description>&lt;p>When push comes to shove, I&amp;rsquo;m a pretty lazy guy.

This guide is for the old UI.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might be vaguely familiar with macros if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever used a computer. Basically, whenever you perform a complicated task with a simple gesture, or reuse complex code with a simple input mechanism, you&amp;rsquo;re using macros. Think keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/tagmanager">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>, this is the essence of macros. You can do away with a lot of complexity by resorting to macros, especially if you ever find that you need the same piece of code or the same operation over and over again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google Tag Manager: The Lookup Table Macro</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-tag-manager-lookup-table-macro/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2014 08:54:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-tag-manager-lookup-table-macro/</guid><description>&lt;p>Having just come hot of the press with my latest article on &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-tag-manager-content-grouping/">GTM and Content Grouping&lt;/a> which, to my delight, Bounteous had written &lt;a href="https://www.bounteous.com/insights/2014/01/24/classify-blog-posts-analytics-content-groupings/">an amazing tutorial&lt;/a> on earlier, &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/+BrianKuhn/">Brian Kuhn&lt;/a> and the amazing Google Tag Manager development team came out with another incredible new feature: The Lookup Table Macro.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In software engineering, a &lt;em>lookup table&lt;/em> is an array which takes away a layer of complexity in runtime computation, and replaces it with a simple value assignment based on array indexing. To put it simply, a lookup table &lt;em>looks&lt;/em> through an array of source values, and &lt;em>assigns&lt;/em> a value to the target depending on what the source value is. Well, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s easiest to show it in an image:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Auto-Event Tracking In Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/auto-event-tracking-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2013 05:20:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/auto-event-tracking-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>There is a new version of this post for GTM V2 &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/auto-event-tracking-gtm-2-0/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://analytics.blogspot.fi/2013/10/the-rundown-new-products-and-features.html">Google Analytics Summit&lt;/a> came and went, and thanks to the Live Stream, everyone could participate. We were treated to a rapid-fire selection of Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; new features, and this post sheds light on one of these in particular: automated event tracking in Google Tag Manager.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Auto-event tracking introduces a nice feature, which does what tag managers ought to do: it provides functionality without HTML template editing. This isn&amp;rsquo;t always a good thing, since automation is usually generic and only works for a couple of viable scenarios, but especially for these generic use cases, this new feature is a great addition to GTM&amp;rsquo;s already impressive feature list.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
