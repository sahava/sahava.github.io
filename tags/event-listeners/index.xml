      <title>Track Interactions In The Shadow DOM Using Google Tag Manager</title>

      <description>The shadow DOM is a way to add HTML structures to the web page so that they remain isolated from the rest of the document object model (DOM). It&#39;s a popular concept with web components, as it allows for encapsulation of web structures so that they aren&#39;t affected by style declarations of the parent tree, for example.
  However, being such a &amp;ldquo;hidden&amp;rdquo; structure, anything that happens in the shadow DOM is also hidden from Google Tag Manager&#39;s listeners.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve written about this before here and here, but this issue remains probably the biggest problem users have when implementing Google Tag Manager.
Tip 10: Resolve conflicts with GTM&#39;s listeners   The tip title is actually wrong. You&#39;re not fixing Google Tag Manager listeners. Rather, you&#39;re resolving conflicts that other scripts on your page might introduce.
GTM&#39;s event listening is based on something called event delegation. Event delegation makes use of the document object model (DOM) and its tree-like hierarchy.</description>
