      <description>At one point in the turbulent year of 2020, you might have gasped in surprise when looking at the preview interface of Google Tag Manager. No, I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the new preview mode interface.
Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m referring to how the Click Element and Form Element built-in variables would now display a CSS path string rather than the expected [object HTMLDivElement] (or equivalent).
  There was good and bad in this update.</description>

      <description>Last updated 24 August 2022: The instructions in this article are no longer that useful, as you can simply use the native JavaScript Element.closest(selector) method instead of the {{Find Closest}} trick described in this article. Browser support for closest has thankfully improved a great deal since this article was originally written.
 Google Tag Manager provides us with a bunch of handy triggers, designed to make capturing user interactions on the website much easier.</description>
