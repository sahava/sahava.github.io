      <description>If you open the Google Tag Manager user interface and browser your tags, triggers, and variables, you might notice that the UI now has two new features:
  Pagination, where only 50 results are shown per page
  A quick search / filter bar at the top of each list, which lets you narrow the list down to results that match your query
  Pagination might be a nuisance in large containers, but it was implemented to improve performance.</description>

      <title>Track Autocomplete Search In Google Tag Manager</title>

      <description>Autocomplete search is a tricky thing to track. The underlying logic is that when the user starts feeding characters into a search form, the search suggests results based on a limited input. If the user is not satisfied with the results, they can continue adding characters to the search, thus increasing the accuracy. Often there&amp;rsquo;s also the option to revert to a regular search with what they&amp;rsquo;ve already written. Tracking this logic in tools like Google Analytics is difficult, because there&amp;rsquo;s really no way to know if the search was successful.</description>
