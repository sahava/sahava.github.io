I mean, you&amp;rsquo;re tracking events here, pageviews there, and user timings, custom dimensions, custom metrics, and calculated metrics are all part of your daily lingo. But you&amp;rsquo;re also probably aware of how futile this tracking is. After all, all you&amp;rsquo;re seeing are numbers that reflect certain outcomes the visitors have produced on the website, and how these outcomes match against your preconceived goals and objectives, right? It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to wrap your head around the individual use cases that constantly take place on the site, and to draw overarching conclusions or unearth business trends on the basis of these data sets can be very problematic indeed.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
