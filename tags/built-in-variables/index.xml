      <description>If you are enjoying the Element Visibility trigger as much as I am, you&amp;rsquo;ll be glad to know of a very simple tip that might make your life easier when using Google Tag Manager.

Tip 92: Use Built-in variables to analyze the visible element   Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s confusing they&amp;rsquo;re still named Click variables, especially since they&amp;rsquo;re duplicated in the Form variables, and even more so since they can be used with the Element Visibility trigger to identify which element became visibility.</description>
