      <description>This article is a collaboration between Simo and Dan Wilkerson. Dan&amp;rsquo;s one of the smartest analytics developers out there, and he&amp;rsquo;s already contributed a great #GTMTips guest post. It&amp;rsquo;s great to have him back here sharing his insight on working with Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP).
So, we&amp;rsquo;re back on AMP! Simo wrote a long, sprawling AMP for Google Tag Manager guide a while ago, and Dan has also contributed to the space with his guide for AMP and Google Analytics.</description>

      <title>Send Mail Upon Google Tag Manager Event</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to set up a rudimentary email alert system in your Google Tag Manager implementation. Say, for example, you want to receive an email every time an uncaught error occurs on your website. It&amp;rsquo;s not a very good use case, since a large website can spawn hundreds of uncaught exceptions in a short period of time, but let&amp;rsquo;s just pretend for now.
If you know your JavaScript, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that you can&amp;rsquo;t send mail using client-side code.</description>
