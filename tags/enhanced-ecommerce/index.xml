&lt;p>There are many reasons to do so, with the biggest one being the flexibility it offers for manipulating the &lt;code>dataLayer&lt;/code> object in case quick changes are required on the site, and it would take too long to wait for a new release of the site JavaScript.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#GTMTips: Use Enhanced Ecommerce Data Layer With Facebook Pixel</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-facebook-pixel/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Feb 2019 13:45:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-facebook-pixel/</guid><description>&lt;p>A recurring question in the &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> communities (e.g. &lt;a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!categories/tag-manager">product forums&lt;/a>) is &lt;strong>how to use an Enhanced Ecommerce &lt;code>dataLayer&lt;/code> object with the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/651294705016616">Facebook pixel code&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>?

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-guide-for-google-tag-manager/">Enhanced Ecommerce&lt;/a> in &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics&lt;/a>. In fact, I think it&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;strong>only&lt;/strong> valid way to deploy Ecommerce tracking today, especially when using &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>. The ability to use a &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-guide-for-google-tag-manager/#send-the-data-to-google-analytics-using-a-custom-javascript-variable">Custom JavaScript variable&lt;/a> and the possibility to tackle the &lt;em>full&lt;/em> ecommerce funnel are some of the benefits of using Enhanced Ecommerce.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, tracking certain view-based events, &lt;strong>impressions&lt;/strong> in particular, has a significant problem when it comes to how Google Analytics processes events. In a nutshell, when implemented by the book, &lt;strong>impressions are sent for all the product impressions on the page when the page is loaded&lt;/strong>. In other words, you are collecting hits from impressions the user &lt;em>might not actually have seen&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Prevent Duplicate Transactions In Google Analytics With customTask</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/prevent-google-analytics-duplicate-transactions-with-customtask/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2019 10:46:43 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/prevent-google-analytics-duplicate-transactions-with-customtask/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the big problems in &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a> data model is the immutability of historical data.

This is especially annoying in two cases: &lt;a href="https://help.analyticsedge.com/article/definitive-guide-to-removing-google-analytics-spam/">spam&lt;/a> and bogus ecommerce hits. The first is a recognized issue with an &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/">open and public data collection protocol&lt;/a>, the latter is an annoyance that can explode into full-blown sabotage (you can use the Measurement Protocol to send hundreds of huge transactions to your competitor&amp;rsquo;s GA property, for example).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enhanced Ecommerce Guide For Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-guide-for-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Sep 2018 08:35:17 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-guide-for-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/enhanced-ecommerce">Enhanced Ecommerce&lt;/a> is certainly one of the finest reporting user interface features that &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics&lt;/a> has to offer. Enhanced Ecommerce, as the name implies, is a set of dimensions, metrics, and reports, which combine to provide you with a fairly complete view into how users are interacting with your products in your webstore. The main downside of Enhanced Ecommerce is, as with all good things, that it&amp;rsquo;s complicated to implement.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>


&lt;p>Luckily, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>. Theoretically, you could implement Enhanced Ecommerce through Google Tag Manager without ever adding a single line of functional logic into the codebase of your web site. You could do everything by simply &lt;a href="#a-word-on-scraping-the-dom">&lt;em>scraping&lt;/em> the Document Object Model&lt;/a> (DOM). However, as we have hopefully learned over the years - GTM is a tool with which fastidiousness trumps fast.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Attribution In Enhanced Ecommerce Reports</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/attribution-enhanced-ecommerce-reports/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2016 08:42:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/attribution-enhanced-ecommerce-reports/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-tips-and-learnings/">Enhanced Ecommerce&lt;/a> is a very useful set of reports in &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics&lt;/a>. They extend the standard Ecommerce funnel, which measures only purchases, and allow you to observe products from the very first impression, through various interactions, all the way to the purchase and even beyond, if the user wanted a refund.

It provides us with a set of reports that truly extend the capabilities of funnel-based website analysis. As I&amp;rsquo;ve shown before, it&amp;rsquo;s also very useful for tracking other transactional events on your site, such as &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-content-enhanced-ecommerce/">content engagement&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>However, here&amp;rsquo;s the thing. It&amp;rsquo;s not very easy to implement. Even if you get everything right according to the documentation, there are still quite a number of pitfalls, and many of the learnings emerge only through experience. This is where I want to help out, so I composed this post with some of my key findings about Enhanced Ecommerce implementation and use.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#GTMTips: Product-Scoped Custom Dimensions And Metrics</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/product-scoped-custom-dimensions-and-metrics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2015 07:01:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/product-scoped-custom-dimensions-and-metrics/</guid><description>&lt;p>With the advent of &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/enhanced-ecommerce">Enhanced Ecommerce for Universal Analytics&lt;/a>, a new &lt;strong>scope&lt;/strong> was introduced for &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/custom-dims-mets">Custom Dimensions and Metrics&lt;/a>. &lt;strong>Product scope&lt;/strong> can be used to send information about each product that is sent through Enhanced Ecommerce, but it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly the most logical or intuitive thing to wrap your head around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/categories/gtm-tips/">#GTMTips&lt;/a> post, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at how to implement Product-Scoped Custom definitions via &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/enhanced-ecommerce">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>, and I&amp;rsquo;ll quickly explain how they work in relation to queries and reports you might want to build on top of them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Measure Cart Value In Enhanced Ecommerce</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/measure-cart-value-in-enhanced-ecommerce/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2015 15:11:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/measure-cart-value-in-enhanced-ecommerce/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the glaring omissions in the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/enhanced-ecommerce">Enhanced Ecommerce&lt;/a> reports of &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com">Universal Analytics&lt;/a> is the ability to calculate &lt;strong>cart value&lt;/strong> for products. &lt;em>Cart value&lt;/em>, here, is the value that has been added to the cart.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This value can be used to query for products that have the highest discrepancy between cart value and generated revenue. These are missed opportunities of the highest caliber.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With some &lt;strong>Custom Metrics&lt;/strong> magic, we can, however, get cart value into our reports, and we can find our most and least &amp;ldquo;effective&amp;rdquo; products with just a glance:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enhanced Ecommerce With A Custom JavaScript Variable</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-with-a-custom-javascript-variable/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2015 08:15:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-with-a-custom-javascript-variable/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/enhanced-ecommerce">Enhanced Ecommerce&lt;/a> is a very nice improvement to the pretty lame, &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/ecommerce">transaction-based Ecommerce&lt;/a> tracking in Universal Analytics. Instead of staring blindly at what happens on a receipt page, Enhanced Ecommerce expands your entire webstore into one large funnel labelled &amp;ldquo;Shopping Behavior&amp;rdquo;, and you&amp;rsquo;re able to zoom in on the Checkout funnel as well. Also, the addition of product-scoped tracking is incredibly useful, and it&amp;rsquo;s enabled us to think of &lt;em>any&lt;/em> asset (&lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-content-enhanced-ecommerce/">our content&lt;/a>, for example) on our site as something we could track through the Enhanced Ecommerce reports.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Track Content With Enhanced Ecommerce</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-content-enhanced-ecommerce/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2014 12:18:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-content-enhanced-ecommerce/</guid><description>&lt;p>My fingers have been tingling to write this article.

&lt;p>In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the steps I went to implement the solution, along with examples of the data I can now access through Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; reporting interface. As you might have guessed, if you&amp;rsquo;ve read my articles before, I implemented Enhanced Ecommerce with Google Tag Manager.

I&amp;rsquo;m sure part of the problem is that eCommerce is for many users the moment that GTM forces you to take steps in to the developer&amp;rsquo;s domain, since it&amp;rsquo;s obvious that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to add some code to the web page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This isn&amp;rsquo;t a tutorial on how to do eCommerce in Google Tag Manager. To get started, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to check out the official documentation. Sure, it might be inaccurate in places, and especially the translations are lacking, but &lt;code>dataLayer&lt;/code> form and function is nicely described within.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
