This statement has been the cornerstone of content strategy in SEO projects, and its validity has hardly been contested. This is not due to lack of trying. Many posts in the blogosphere have taken an opposing stand (Heidi Cohen: &lt;a href="http://heidicohen.com/blogging-content-is-not-king/">format is king&lt;/a>, Carl Ocab: &lt;a href="http://www.carlocab.com/i-have-a-secret-content-is-not-king/">marketing is king&lt;/a>, Bernadette Coleman: &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/content-isnt-king-trust-is-king">trust is king&lt;/a>). The message of the opposition is this: content cannot be king, as it is only a small part of the audience experience.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
