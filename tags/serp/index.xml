It&amp;rsquo;s all about uncovering &lt;strong>bounce&lt;/strong> metrics for visits which originate from organic Google search results. In particular, the metric we&amp;rsquo;re interested in is how long user &lt;em>dwelled&lt;/em> on the landing page after arriving from organic Google search &lt;strong>AND&lt;/strong> returned to the search engine results page (SERP) using the browser&amp;rsquo;s back button.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The inspiration for this post came from an audience question at the Best Internet Conference in Lithuania, which I recently attended as a speaker. They were concerned that Google is using Bounce Rate as a search ranking signal, and I was fairly strongly opinionated that it&amp;rsquo;s simply not possible, as all the &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; GA metrics are really easy to manipulate. However, Dr. Pete from Moz wrote about &lt;a href="https://moz.com/blog/the-2-user-metrics-that-matter-for-seo">&lt;em>dwell time&lt;/em>&lt;/a> in 2012, and it makes a lot of sense. Google should be &lt;strong>very&lt;/strong> interested how long the visitor stays out of the SERP when following a link. If users tend to immediately return to the SERP, it&amp;rsquo;s very likely the result was not relevant for them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dynamically Added Meta Data Indexed By Google Crawlers</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/seo/dynamically-added-meta-data-indexed-google-crawlers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2015 11:30:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/seo/dynamically-added-meta-data-indexed-google-crawlers/</guid><description>&lt;p>Quick history. On May 23, 2014, the following announcement was made on the Google Webmaster Central Blog:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>In order to solve this problem, we decided to try to understand pages by executing JavaScript. It's hard to do that at the scale of the current web, but we decided that it's worth it. We have been gradually improving how we do this for some time. In the past few months, our indexing system has been rendering a substantial number of web pages more like an average user's browser with JavaScript turned on.&lt;/blockquote>
