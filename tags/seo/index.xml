      <title>Measure SERP Bounce Time With GTM</title>

      <description>Here&#39;s an interesting and hacky use case for you. It&#39;s all about uncovering bounce metrics for visits which originate from organic Google search results. In particular, the metric we&#39;re interested in is how long user dwelled on the landing page after arriving from organic Google search AND returned to the search engine results page (SERP) using the browser&#39;s back button.
  The inspiration for this post came from an audience question at the Best Internet Conference in Lithuania, which I recently attended as a speaker.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Added Meta Data Indexed By Google Crawlers</title>

      <description>Quick history. On May 23, 2014, the following announcement was made on the Google Webmaster Central Blog:
In order to solve this problem, we decided to try to understand pages by executing JavaScript. It&#39;s hard to do that at the scale of the current web, but we decided that it&#39;s worth it. We have been gradually improving how we do this for some time. In the past few months, our indexing system has been rendering a substantial number of web pages more like an average user&#39;s browser with JavaScript turned on.</description>

      <title>Enrich SERP Results Using GTM</title>

      <description>Google has a myriad of ways to make the search engine results page (SERP) livelier. When you input a search query, the engine&#39;s mission is to provide you with the most relevant information with as few clicks as possible. Often, this means that you&#39;ll see the answer to your query directly in the SERP:
  See also Dr. Pete&#39;s excellent description of variation in the SERP (note that this post is from 2013, and not all the data types are relevant today).</description>

      <title>How To (Not) Make A Splash</title>

      <description>A word of warning. This is not a developers&amp;rsquo; post, a guide, or a thought experiment. This is a bona fide rant. Sometimes we just need to vent.
A couple of weeks ago, I checked one of our (inactive) client&#39;s Google Analytics accounts I still had access to. What I saw in the acquisition report was this:
  See how direct traffic gobbles up a great big share of organic traffic in late October?</description>

      <description>My days as a freewheeling, unrestrained, happy-go-lucky, gung-ho city cowboy are over. As of 31 August 2013, I&#39;m a married man, and for the rest of my life, I will dedicate myself to optimizing my relationship to my beautiful wife. The old ball-and-chain. But before I bury myself in the bosom of our bless√®d alliance, I&#39;ll continue to blog about the dark and murky undergrowth of digital marketing that SEO is.</description>

      <description>So you&#39;ve spent a whopping amount of money on paid search, SEO, Facebook ads, competitions, link building, and traditional marketing. You&#39;re seeing a crazy influx of visitors to your site. Just as you&#39;re about to call your boss to accept the promotion, you notice a worrying trend: your new visitors are barely making an impression on conversions from online traffic. What&#39;s up with that? All your high-paid consultants told you that a high return of investment is guaranteed, since The Internet is da bomb, everything is cheap, and percentages are always in your favor!</description>

      <title>Website Redesign With SEO And Common Sense</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/seo/website-redesign-with-seo/</link>

      <description>So it&#39;s been a while, I know. I&#39;ve been enjoying my summer vacation, either swimming in the lush blue waters of Finland&#39;s lakes or in the murky, greenish, (only slightly toxic) chemistry lab reject also known as the Baltic Sea. I&#39;ve also had the pleasure of playing golf only to realize I&#39;m roughly at the same skill level I was at when I first started.
  I blame the fact I&#39;ve played less than ever before due to some unexpected patellofemoral pain in my right knee (yes, I know it&#39;s called the Runner&#39;s Knee, but if I know words like patellofemoral, I will use them).</description>

      <title>Why Learning SEO Is (Probably) Good For You</title>

      <description>Before I begin, it is important to note that SEO, as any other facet of web design, covers both technique and purpose. Technique in the sense that SEO comprises a number of de facto guidelines (and accompanying tools) which help improve the search engine friendliness of your website. With purpose I mean the elusive concept of setting goals, and how to pursue them. Both are incredibly important aspects of learning SEO, and it can be argued that one cannot exist without the other.</description>

      <title>It&#39;s Not About Marketing</title>

      <description>In a recent post, I took a short foray into the world of clumsy analogies by comparing the team work qualities (and necessities) of basketball and digital marketing. In an even earlier post, I made the claim that the single most important facet of content strategy is audience design. Well, now is the time to pull these two threads together all trilogy-like. After this, you can hail me as the Stieg Larsson of marketing.</description>

      <title>How Is Digital Marketing Like Basketball?</title>

      <description>So I was watching the 2013 NBA Eastern Conference Finals game 7 between Miami Heat and Indiana Pacers. While making note of the dozens of different ways that the lackluster Pacers were taken to the cleaners by the dominant Miami team (read: LeBron James), I started churning a funky thought in my head. This beautiful, wonderful, exciting, adrenaline-pumping, superstar-studded, tattoo-galore of a game must be an analogy of something. Something equally thought-provoking, exhilarating and life-changing.</description>

      <description>I recently started rewriting some of the templates we use for SEO reports at my company. I first thought that the task would be a simple one. Just rewrite all the SEO stuff to match the latest trends, add more diagrams, charts, and graphs, and make it more personal by increasing the number of client-specific sections. However, soon I started to question my motives (as I usually do when doing something independently).</description>

      <title>SEO In A Nutshell (And Some Tips)</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Oh no, not another &amp;lsquo;SEO in a nutshell&amp;rsquo; post!&amp;rdquo; I hear you scream. Oh yes! And to make matters worse, I&#39;m actually calling this SEO In A Nutshell just out of spite! But why, oh why, must I litter the otherwise so clean and orderly forum that Internet is with yet another here&#39;s-what-something-is-in-case-you-ever-cared-post? I promise, I&#39;m only doing this for selfish reasons. I&#39;m not trying to buy myself into the major league by posting about something that everyone else is posting about.</description>

      <description>When Matt Cutts speaks, the world listens. We reach out our hands to catch even the tiniest morsels that make up the bread that fills the basket that is Google. We hush in anticipation, as we know that we are about to be revealed another piece of the puzzle that is Google&#39;s search algorithms. We want to know these dark, esoteric, technological secrets because a) as humans we are genetically coded to abhor secrets and shadow-talk, and b) as SEOs we are competing in a business where only the first place is rewarded.</description>

      <title>Checklist For Optimizing Web Design</title>

      <description>In this post, I propose that a combination of valid, accessible, and search engine friendly markup is the perfect recipe for optimal web design.
For markup to be valid, it needs to conform to the guidelines laid out by the &amp;ldquo;governing body&amp;rdquo; of HTML standardization: the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C. While the Internet anxiously waits for HTML5 to shift in status from candidate to recommendation, we&#39;re stuck with ye olde HTML 4.</description>
