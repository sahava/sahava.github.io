This blog is published via &lt;a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress&lt;/a>, a modern CMS if there ever was one. In fact, if you add a comment to this post with the form below (hint, hint), you will be participating in content creation, using tools that come out-of-the-box in this particular platform.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But what makes a modern CMS? Is WordPress the perfect choice for you or your business? Well, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to review the products on the market, so I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the second question to you or your IT manager. However, I will take a stand on the first question, as I look at what makes a modern content management system. What are the must-have features it should boast, and what can you live without? My word is not doctrine, but I do have a long history of working with CMS&amp;rsquo;s and with clients who only want the best.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
