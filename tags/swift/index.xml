      <title>iOS Quickstart With Google Analytics For Firebase And Google Tag Manager</title>

      <description>A while ago, I published an article on how to build an Android application, and bundle it with Firebase. The purpose of that article, and the one you are reading now, is to slowly introduce the world of mobile app development and Firebase, given the latter is getting more and more traction as Google&#39;s go-to analytics platform.
After finishing work on the Android guide, I immediately started working on its counterpart for iOS, and that&#39;s the one you&#39;re reading now.</description>

      <title>#GTMTips: Track Launch Campaigns In GTM For iOS</title>

      <description>In Google Analytics for iOS, there are two types of campaign measurement. There&#39;s install campaign measurement, which lets you track the channels which brought your visitors to the App Store, where they proceeded to download your app. There&#39;s also launch campaign tracking, which lets you attribute app launches to specific campaigns.
In this tip post, we&#39;ll tackle the latter. We&#39;ll leverage a feature of the Google Analytics iOS SDK to build the parameters, and then push them to dataLayer so that they can be used in the Tag.</description>

      <title>#GTMTips: Useful GTM For iOS Tips</title>

      <description>A while ago I wrote a blog post about how to install Google Tag Manager for iOS using the Swift programming language (you can read the article here). I&#39;ve been doing a lot of work with Swift lately, and I&#39;m more and more convinced that GTM is actually a very powerful utility for running in your iOS app instead of the Google Analytics SDK.
Why? Because it abstracts a lot of the nitty-gritty you&#39;d otherwise need to explicitly manage in your GA installation.</description>

      <title>Setup Google Tag Manager iOS With Swift</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve been meaning to write about Google Tag Manager for mobile apps for such a long time. Finally, I have some great use cases to share, as well as some useful examples for implementing GTM for iOS. That&#39;s right, this is an iOS guide, and, to be more specific, geared towards a successful Swift implementation.
  If you didn&#39;t know, Swift is a relatively new programming language, developed by Apple for iOS and OS X programming.</description>
