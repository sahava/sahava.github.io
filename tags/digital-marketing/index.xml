In an even earlier post, I made the claim that the single most important facet of &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/seo/content-strategy-know-your-audience/">content strategy is audience design&lt;/a>.

While making note of the dozens of different ways that the lackluster Pacers were &lt;a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/miami-tops-upstart-indiana-pacers-game-7-earning-033337361.html">taken to the cleaners&lt;/a> by the dominant Miami team (read: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAUMJTv0s9g">LeBron James&lt;/a>), I started churning a funky thought in my head. This beautiful, wonderful, exciting, adrenaline-pumping, superstar-studded, tattoo-galore of a game &lt;strong>must&lt;/strong> be an analogy of something. Something equally thought-provoking, exhilarating and life-changing. Oh! I know! &lt;strong>Digital marketing&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
