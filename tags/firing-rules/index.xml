Each of these three events signals a specific stage in the page load process. Here are the events (be sure to read my &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-tag-manager-playing-rules/">guide on GTM rules&lt;/a> to understand further what these events do):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>gtm.js&lt;/em> - This is pushed into the data layer as soon as GTM is initialized and the container is loaded. This is also the default event for all rules without an explicit event macro rule as a condition. Basically, if you want something to happen at the earliest possible moment, you need to have &lt;strong>{{event}} equals gtm.js&lt;/strong> as the rule&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
