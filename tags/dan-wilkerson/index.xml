Dan&amp;rsquo;s one of the smartest analytics developers out there, and he&amp;rsquo;s already contributed a great &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/using-document-write-safely-gtm-tags/">#GTMTips guest post&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s great to have him back here sharing his insight on working with &lt;a href="https://www.ampproject.org/">Accelerated Mobile Pages&lt;/a> (AMP).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we&amp;rsquo;re back on AMP! Simo wrote a long, sprawling &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/accelerated-mobile-pages-via-google-tag-manager/">AMP for Google Tag Manager guide&lt;/a> a while ago, and Dan has also contributed to the space with his guide for &lt;a href="https://www.bounteous.com/insights/2015/12/08/google-analytics-using-amp/">AMP and Google Analytics&lt;/a>. Both of these guides touched upon a subject that might be one of the reasons to stay away from AMP for now: Client ID matching across AMP, your regular website, and any caches or CDNs that serve the AMP version.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#GTMTips: Using document.write Safely In GTM Tags</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/using-document-write-safely-gtm-tags/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2016 07:25:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/using-document-write-safely-gtm-tags/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article is a guest article by someone from the analytics community I really look up to. &lt;a href="https://www.bounteous.com/insights/author/danwilkerson/">Dan Wilkerson&lt;/a> is an analytics developer at &lt;a href="https://www.bounteous.com/">Bounteous&lt;/a>, a company I hold in high esteem. Dan is one of the smartest technical analytics experts out there, and a large bulk of the awesome scripts and hacks that Bounteous produces (almost on a daily basis) have been orchestrated by him. So I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased to give the floor to Dan, so that he can tell you all about using the pesky &lt;code>document.write()&lt;/code> method in your &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> Custom HTML Tags!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
