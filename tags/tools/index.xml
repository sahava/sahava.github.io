      <description>(UPDATE 3 Apr 2017: There is a newer version of GTM Tools out, so please ignore this article and read this one instead.)
So, the time has come to update my GTM Tools. I released the first toolset in October 2014, and it performed its duties just well enough. Sure, the UI was ugly as hell, and there were bugs along the way, but for cloning containers, macros, and rules, and for visualizing containers, it was just good enough.</description>

      <description>[UPDATE:] Quite a lot of people had trouble accessing the tool after I published this post. This should now be fixed.
So, AWESOME stuff. The new Google Tag Manager UI and API have just rolled out, and I can finally start revealing the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on :)
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into the new UI in this post. I just want to give a huge thanks to the GTM team for working on the UX with such dedication.</description>
