It also helps to be active in community support, since problem-solving is an excellent way to accumulate new skills and to hone the edge of your existing talent.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enhanced Ecommerce Tips And Learnings</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-tips-and-learnings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2015 07:55:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-tips-and-learnings/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/enhanced-ecommerce">Enhanced Ecommerce&lt;/a> is undoubtedly an excellent feature of &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics&lt;/a>. It provides us with a set of reports that truly extend the capabilities of funnel-based website analysis. As I&amp;rsquo;ve shown before, it&amp;rsquo;s also very useful for tracking other transactional events on your site, such as &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-content-enhanced-ecommerce/">content engagement&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>However, here&amp;rsquo;s the thing. It&amp;rsquo;s not very easy to implement. Even if you get everything right according to the documentation, there are still quite a number of pitfalls, and many of the learnings emerge only through experience.

In an even earlier post, I made the claim that the single most important facet of &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/seo/content-strategy-know-your-audience/">content strategy is audience design&lt;/a>. Well, now is the time to pull these two threads together all trilogy-like. After this, you can hail me as the &lt;a href="http://www.stieglarsson.com/">Stieg Larsson&lt;/a> of marketing.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
