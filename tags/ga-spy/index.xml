&lt;p>&lt;strong>READ THIS (26 Aug 2019)!!&lt;/strong> Unfortunately, the update I made in 2016 contained code that was incomplete and broken. I nevert noticed this until it was pointed out to me almost three years later. At this point, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a working backup of the solution, so unless some internet archive / cache service manages to surface the code, this article is basically lost.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>UPDATE 20 December 2016: I made some fixes to the solution - be sure to grab the latest code snippet from below!&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
