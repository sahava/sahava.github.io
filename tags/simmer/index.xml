      <title>Thoughts On Education</title>

      <description>As my LinkedIn inbox graciously reminded me that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on Simmer for a full three years now, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share a couple of observations about education â€“ particularly in the world of technical digital marketing.
Online courses are an interesting vehicle for education. The medium offers a plethora of different approaches to knowledge transfer, student assessment, and collaboration. It seems like a no-brainer in today&amp;rsquo;s day and age, particularly for someone who wants to build a platform that scales beyond in-person tuition.</description>

      <description>This will likely be the shortest blog article I have ever written, but I have just one short thing to say:
SIMMER IS LIVE!
Simmer is a new online course platform, where we bring technical marketing courses to your computer (or mobile device) screen with a straightforward, task-based approach.
Our first class is aptly Server-side Tagging In Google Tag Manager, and it is open for enrollment right now, all the way until March 14th.</description>
