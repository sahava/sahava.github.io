      <title>Snowplow Analytics Templates For Google Tag Manager</title>

      <description>When custom templates were released for Google Tag Manager, I updated my workflow for working with GTM. Instead of rushing to the Custom HTML tag and the Custom JavaScript variable, I started considering whether the custom scripts could be transformed into custom template first.
While publishing numerous templates into the community gallery, I always spent some time over the past 12 months tinkering on an extremely complicated template translation: the Snowplow Analytics JavaScript tracker.</description>

      <description>Update 6 April 2020: I updated the template in the gallery to the latest version of the IP Geolocation API SDK, which no longer requires jQuery. Also, the SDK now handles API request caching to browser storage automatically, so the &amp;ldquo;Enable Session Storage&amp;rdquo; option was added to the template.
 Google Analytics had been foreshadowing the deprecation of the Network Domain and Service Provider custom dimensions since late 2019. On February 4, the plug was finally pulled, and both these dimensions started flatlining to (not set) in Google Analytics reports.</description>

      <title>CDNJS Hosted Libraries Template For Google Tag Manager</title>

      <description>One of the prime things to use Google Tag Manager for is script injection. Loading a third-party JavaScript library is trivial to do with a Custom HTML tag, and works like a charm.
However, using Custom HTML tags for, well, anything, is no longer the preferred way to add custom code to the site. Custom HTML tags are pretty expensive DOM injections, and they can be incredibly dangerous tools (for UX, security, and privacy) in the wrong and/or inexperienced hands.</description>

 My latest custom tag template tackles a use case I&#39;ve referred to a number of times before, especially in my article on sending weather data to Google Analytics.</description>

      <description>Universal Analytics utilizes two components (by default) to attribute a browser session to a specific campaign: query parameters in the URL and the referrer string.
The page URL is sent with every hit to Google Analytics using the Document location field, which also translates to the &amp;amp;dl parameter in the Measurement Protocol.
The referrer string is sent with a hit to Google Analytics using the Document referrer field, as long as the referrer hostname does not exactly match that of the current page and the referrer string is not empty.</description>

      <title>#GTMTips: Walkthrough Of Custom Template Tests</title>

      <description>Google Tag Manager now lets you add unit tests directly to your custom templates. This is useful, since it allows you to control the code stability of your templates, especially if you&#39;ve decided to share those templates with the public.
I recently shared a general guide for how template tests work, but I wanted to expand the topic a little, and share with you two walkthroughs of custom template tests: one for a variable template and one for a tag template.</description>

      <title>Writing Tests For Custom Templates In Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/writing-tests-for-custom-templates-google-tag-manager/</link>

      <description>Google Tag Manager introduced the capability to add tests to your Custom Templates. Tests, in this context, refer specifically to unit tests that you write in order to make sure your template code works in a predictable way. Unit tests are also used to drive development, ensuring that you have added contingencies for all the different scenarios that the template, when coupled with user input, might introduce.
  In this guide, I&#39;ll introduce how the Tests feature works.</description>

      <title>Community Template Gallery For Google Tag Manager - Introduction And Tips For Use</title>

      <description>Since the introduction of custom templates in May 2019, the community (myself included) has been anxiously waiting for some official solution for curating and distributing templates created by the community.
Now, finally, we have it. It&#39;s called the Community Template Gallery! Read Google&#39;s announcement in this blog post.
  I&#39;m not going to go over the basics in this article, since Google&#39;s own documentation stands fine on its own feet.</description>

      <title>User Distributor Custom Tag Template For Google Tag Manager</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve enjoyed working with custom templates for Google Tag Manager. A lot. So much so that whenever the need to add some custom code to a container emerges, my first thought is how to turn that into a custom template.
Google has been forthcoming in introducing new APIs steadily, and I think the variety of things you can do with template is improving with every new API release.
In this article, I&#39;ll show you how to use a simple tag template for distributing your users to groups, based on a random split.</description>

      <title>#GTMTips: Introducing The GTM Templates Library</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/introducing-gtm-templates-library/</link>

      <description>When Custom Templates were released in Google Tag Manager, many of us active in the GTM communities started doing two things: 1) creating our own custom templates, and 2) waiting patiently for Google to release a &amp;ldquo;gallery&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;library&amp;rdquo; for distributing these community contributions.
While I have full faith in the latter happening some time in the future, I thought it would be fun to create something similar to a library, and then open-sourcing it for the community to help out with or to download locally for their own purposes.</description>

      <title>How To Build A Google Tag Manager Monitor</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-tag-manager-monitor/</link>

      <description>Google Tag Manager is strictly a tag delivery system, and it&#39;s very careful not to collect any analytics data on its own. This is most likely a deliberate choice, because if GTM was to start collecting data, it would introduce additional barriers to adoption.
Nevertheless, being a tool that consolidates the design, development, deployment, and testing of all the marketing and analytics pixels, code snippets, and utilities running on a website or a mobile app, lacking the necessary features for auditing and monitoring has always seemed like an oversight.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Ecommerce Object Builder Template For Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-builder-custom-variable-template/</link>

      <description>One of the cool things about Enhanced Ecommerce deployments in Google Tag Manager is that you can use a Custom JavaScript variable to generate the necessary data.
There are many reasons to do so, with the biggest one being the flexibility it offers for manipulating the dataLayer object in case quick changes are required on the site, and it would take too long to wait for a new release of the site JavaScript.</description>

      <description>After the recent release of Custom Templates for Google Tag Manager, my mind has been occupied by very little else. However, I have a nagging feeling that due to how involved the feature set is, there&#39;s still a lot of demystifying that needs to take place before templates are fully embraced by the GTM user base.
In this article, I want to show you a concrete example of template creation. It&#39;s going to be much more ambitious than the simple walkthrough I explored in the main guide.</description>

      <description>As I have finally managed to pick up my jaw from the floor, it&#39;s now time to tell you what&#39;s got me so excited. Google Tag Manager recently released a new feature called Custom Templates. Actually, it&#39;s not fair to call it a feature. It&#39;s a full-blown paradigm shift in how we use Google Tag Manager. It&#39;s a suite of features designed to help brands, companies, and users create and share their own custom JavaScript and HTML setups with ease, while taking care that the code is optimized for delivery in the web browser.</description>
