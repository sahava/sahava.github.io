      <description>You can use the customTask Builder tool to create a customTask script. customTask is a method of the Google Analytics library, which lets you run JavaScript code when the hit request to Google Analytics is being built.
 Click here to jump directly to the tool.
 This is very useful for a number of reasons, and I recommend you read customTask - The Guide before doing anything with the tool.</description>

      <title>Custom Dimension Manager For Google Analytics</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/tools/google-analytics-custom-dimension-manager/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/tools/google-analytics-custom-dimension-manager/</guid>
      <description>The Custom Dimension Manager For Google Analytics is a Google Sheets add-on. It lets you update Custom Dimensions in any given Google Analytics property en masse.   When updating, new dimensions are created automatically with values from a source data sheet (or using a default value if no value is specified), and for existing dimensions you have the choice to update or skip.   The add-on is completely free to use.</description>

      <description>The Google Analytics Validator is a Google Sheets add-on. It lets you build a spreadsheet of all the accounts, properties, and views you have access to in Google Analytics. Then, you can select any number of these properties to populate a second sheet, where each Custom Dimension configured in the property is displayed with its name, scope, and active status.   Finally, you can poll for the last 7 days data for any selected property/view to see if the Custom Dimension has collected any hits.</description>

      <description>GTM Tools are utilities created for managing Google Tag Manager containers. The main features are:
 Clone containers from one account to another (or within the same account)
 Visualize containers
 Inspect containers, and add individual assets (Tags, Triggers, Variables) to a &amp;ldquo;Shopping cart&amp;rdquo;
 Clone Shopping cart contents as a new container in a GTM account
 Save Shopping cart contents into an asset library for future use</description>

      <title>Spam Filter Insertion Tool</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/spam-filter/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2016 06:13:52 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/spam-filter/</guid>
      <description>I took my Spam Filter Insertion Tool down since it&amp;rsquo;s very ineffective for tackling referral spam in Google Analytics. There are far better ways to combat spam.
You can still download the source in the GitHub repository if you want to build the tool yourself.</description>

      <description>I started writing articles in May, 2013. The first couple of articles written during the first months of this blog&amp;rsquo;s life were not very good. Things picked up when I started focusing only on Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager articles.
The following statistics are powered by Google Data Studio.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written a bunch of tools to help you use and debug Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics. I&amp;rsquo;m neither a professional product developer nor am I a visual designer, and both correlate with how the tools look like and what their user experience is :)
Nevertheless, I only create tools that I want to use myself, and being a sort of power-user especially in the development side of things, I do think that these little utilities provide added value to your tag management needs.</description>
