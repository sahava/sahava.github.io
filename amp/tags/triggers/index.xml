      <title>Trigger Groups In Google Tag Manager</title>

      <description>Trigger Group is the newest trigger type you can add to a tag in Google Tag Manager. It allows you to establish dependencies between multiple triggers, not firing the tag until every trigger in the group has fired at least once.
  This establishes an interesting new paradigm in Google Tag Manager, because until now it wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible to create triggers that relied on earlier values of a given key (event in this case).</description>

      <title>Fire GTM Tag Upon Scroll Depth And Time Spent</title>

      <description>Over 5 years ago, I wrote an article titled Track Adjusted Bounce Rate In Universal Analytics. It basically explored a number of different methods to tweak the Bounce Rate metric so that it becomes more meaningful in your Google Analytics reports.
Now, writing that article wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily my proudest moment. It&amp;rsquo;s not because the solution was poor, but rather because I was suggesting it makes sense to tweak a metric.</description>

      <title>Customize The Scroll Depth Trigger In Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/customize-scroll-depth-trigger/</link>

      <description>Last updated 9 March 2018 with some new tips.
The Scroll Depth trigger in Google Tag Manager has a lot going for it. Tracking how far users scroll down a given page has long since been recognized as an important cog in the engagement tracking machine, and there have been really great solutions for implementing scroll depth tracking for web analytics over the years.
With Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s native Scroll Depth trigger, it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to think we now have a be-all end-all solution that covers all the bases.</description>

      <description>This is one of those #GTMTips posts that I was certain I&amp;rsquo;d already written. So it came as a mild surprise when I realized I&amp;rsquo;d never tackled this aspect of Google Tag Manager.
It&amp;rsquo;s a short and sweet tip again. Today we&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to check if a variable is undefined using Google Tag Manager.
Tip 73: Check for undefined variable values   If a variable is undefined, it means that a variable with the given name does not currently have any valid value in memory.</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager should be relatively easy to implement. Just paste the container snippet to the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; of the page and you&amp;rsquo;re good to go! However, at some point you&amp;rsquo;ll want to configure the dataLayer structure, too (read more about dataLayer here). There are two ways to do it: the right way and the wrong way.
In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens if you do it the wrong way, how to identify the issue, and how to fix it.</description>

      <description>This is, by no means, a novel topic in this blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve covered Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s event tracking and triggers numerous times before (see below).

      <title>#GTMTips: The Timer Trigger</title>

      <description>Google Tag Manager has a Trigger type which fires after a certain duration of time has passed on the web page: the Timer Trigger. The most common uses for the Timer Trigger seem to be either to send an event to Google Analytics after X seconds of dwell time (to kill the Bounce), or to defer a Tag from firing until some asynchronous request has completed with certainty.
In the previous version of Google Tag Manager, the Timer was a separate listener Tag, which meant that you could start a timer based on a user interaction such as a click.</description>

      <description>Every now and then I run into a problem which needs some creativity to find a fix. When choosing a course of action, I tend to land first on an extremely complicated solution. However, if I&amp;rsquo;m patient enough, I manage to whittle it down to something far more manageable and efficient.
In this #GTMTips post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you one of these extremely simple solutions to a problem which you might normally overcomplicate.</description>

      <title>Firing A Single Tag Multiple Times In GTM</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/firing-a-single-tag-multiple-times-in-gtm/</link>

      <description>There might be many reasons you&amp;rsquo;d want to fire a single Tag multiple times in Google Tag Manager. The most common one is when you want to deploy multiples of a single tracking point on the web. Perhaps you have a roll-up account you want to send the hits to, in addition to the site-specific tracking property.
Quite a while ago, I gave a solution for this with a specific focus on Google Analytics Tags.</description>

      <title>#GTMTips: Block Your Tags With Trigger Exceptions</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/block-your-tags-with-trigger-exceptions/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/block-your-tags-with-trigger-exceptions/</guid>
      <description>To prevent a Tag from firing in Google Tag Manager, you can:
 Delete the Tag
 Remove all Triggers from the Tag
 Add an Exception Trigger to the Tag
  The third option is usually the best if the blocking is just temporary. Exceptions are what used to be called blocking rules in the first version of GTM. To add them is easy enough. In the Fire On step of Tag creation, you can click Create Exceptions, and choose the Trigger that will block this Tag from firing.</description>

      <title>#GTMtips: Use The All Pages Trigger Correctly</title>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a very quick tip this time, but one that&amp;rsquo;s caused a lot of headache for many Google Tag Manager users.
Tip 21: Use the All Pages Trigger correctly   Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, All Pages isn&amp;rsquo;t really an intuitive Trigger name. Many seem to interpret it as: enable the Tag to fire on all pages, but use the other Trigger (e.g. Link Click) to actually fire it.
As it turns out, the All Pages Trigger will fire the Tag on all pages.</description>

      <description>Be honest, can you think of anything that&amp;rsquo;s more unfair than this:
  A new Google Tag Manager feature, published at 02:07 AM my time, and with an easter egg hunt involved?! Of course it was the infuriating Charles Farina who found the new feature and claimed the prize. Curses! (Just kidding Charles, you&amp;rsquo;re still awesome.)
  Anyway, there&amp;rsquo;s a new GTM feature in town, and oh boy, this time it&amp;rsquo;s a big&amp;rsquo;un!</description>

      <description>Updated 27 March 2019
 In the new version of Google Tag Manager, one of the most visible and profound changes to the previous version is how tags are fired (and blocked). First of all, there&amp;rsquo;s the obvious terminological distinction: we talk about triggers now, not rules. Second, triggers have become an integral part of the tag creation workflow, and as such have far more significance in the user interface than before.</description>
