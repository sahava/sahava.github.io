It basically explored a number of different methods to tweak the Bounce Rate metric so that it becomes more meaningful in your &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics&lt;/a> reports.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, writing that article wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily my proudest moment. It&amp;rsquo;s not because the solution was poor, but rather because I was suggesting it makes sense to &lt;strong>tweak a metric&lt;/strong>. The concept of &amp;ldquo;adjusted Bounce Rate&amp;rdquo; sounds like the analyst is fixing a metric to be more beneficial to their cause, rather than fixing the business problem that caused the metric to be poor in the first place.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#GTMTips: The Timer Trigger</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/timer-trigger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2016 10:02:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/timer-trigger/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> has a &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/trigger-guide-google-tag-manager/">Trigger&lt;/a> type which fires after a certain duration of time has passed on the web page: the Timer Trigger. The most common uses for the Timer Trigger seem to be either to send an event to Google Analytics after X seconds of dwell time (to kill the Bounce), or to defer a Tag from firing until some asynchronous request has completed with certainty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the previous version of Google Tag Manager, the Timer was a separate listener Tag, which meant that you could start a timer based on a user interaction such as a click. In the current version of GTM, this is no longer possible, as the Timer Trigger will only start when GTM is first loaded on the page. So, one of the tips in this article will be how create your own Timer, in case you want to start one based on some other stimulus than the Page View.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
