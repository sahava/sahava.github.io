This means that if you mistakenly collect &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/prevent-google-analytics-duplicate-transactions-with-customtask/">duplicate or incorrect transactions&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/remove-pii-google-analytics-hits/">PII traffic&lt;/a>, or &lt;a href="https://help.analyticsedge.com/article/definitive-guide-to-removing-google-analytics-spam/">referral spam&lt;/a>, for example, it&amp;rsquo;s extremely difficult, if not downright impossible, to purge or change this data in Google Analytics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another staple of Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; strict schema is that &lt;strong>displacing hits in time&lt;/strong> is also very difficult. Hits are digested as they come in, and they are placed in time in the order of processing. If Google Analytics collects hit B after hit A, then it will be reported as having occurred in that order, too.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
