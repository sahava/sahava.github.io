      <title>Track Interactions In The Shadow DOM Using Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-interactions-in-shadow-dom-google-tag-manager/</link>

      <description>The shadow DOM is a way to add HTML structures to the web page so that they remain isolated from the rest of the document object model (DOM). It&amp;rsquo;s a popular concept with web components, as it allows for encapsulation of web structures so that they aren&amp;rsquo;t affected by style declarations of the parent tree, for example.
  However, being such a &amp;ldquo;hidden&amp;rdquo; structure, anything that happens in the shadow DOM is also hidden from Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s listeners.</description>

      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/send-page-visibility-state-to-ga/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/send-page-visibility-state-to-ga/</guid>
      <description>One of my pet peeves about Google Analytics has to do with nomenclature. For example, a User isn&amp;rsquo;t really a user but a browser instance, and Direct traffic isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily &amp;ldquo;direct&amp;rdquo; at all, but rather just traffic that has no discernible source. But being so invested in content analytics, my biggest gripe has to do with Pageviews.
A Pageview in Google Analytics is collected when a hit with the hit type pageview is received successfully by the Google Analytics endpoint.</description>

      <title>Google Tag Manager And jQuery</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-tag-manager-and-jquery/</link>

      <description>The jQuery JavaScript library is by almost any means of counting the most popular JavaScript library used in websites around the world. It&amp;rsquo;s so influential, in fact, that its evolution is tightly bound to the JavaScript standardization effort itself, and it&amp;rsquo;s an integral part of the JS Foundation&amp;rsquo;s efforts to build a community for JavaScript developers.
  Google Tag Manager, similarly, is the most popular tag management system used in websites, globally.</description>

      <title>#GTMTips: Trigger Javascript Function Without Using A Custom HTML Tag</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/trigger-javascript-without-using-custom-html-tag/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/trigger-javascript-without-using-custom-html-tag/</guid>
      <description>Last updated 3 September 2020: customTask has changed how it exposes the model object, so the code in this article has been updated. Thanks to Ritvik Sharma for the solution.
 The Custom HTML tag in Google Tag Manager is splendid. It&amp;rsquo;s your go-to tool when you need to run arbitrary JavaScript on the webpage. Some might even use it to actually add HTML elements to the page, but I&amp;rsquo;m willing to bet running JavaScript is its most common use.</description>

      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/search-datalayer-for-key-value-pair/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/search-datalayer-for-key-value-pair/</guid>
      <description>One of the difficulties of working with Google Tag Manager and the dataLayer structure is that GTM doesn&amp;rsquo;t preserve history of the items collected into its data model. Or, at least, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t preserve it in a manner that would let us access it.
This is typically a very niche problem, but it does surface every now and then. For example, say you wanted to query whether an event with some specific value has already been pushed into dataLayer.</description>

      <title>Customize The Scroll Depth Trigger In Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/customize-scroll-depth-trigger/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/customize-scroll-depth-trigger/</guid>
      <description>Last updated 9 March 2018 with some new tips.
The Scroll Depth trigger in Google Tag Manager has a lot going for it. Tracking how far users scroll down a given page has long since been recognized as an important cog in the engagement tracking machine, and there have been really great solutions for implementing scroll depth tracking for web analytics over the years.
With Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s native Scroll Depth trigger, it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to think we now have a be-all end-all solution that covers all the bases.</description>

      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/add-html-elements-page-programmatically/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/add-html-elements-page-programmatically/</guid>
      <description>One of the annoying quirks of Google Tag Manager is that it strips out any non-standard HTML attributes from elements you add to Custom HTML tags. I&amp;rsquo;m using &amp;ldquo;non-standard&amp;rdquo; as a qualifier here, because I don&amp;rsquo;t have an exhaustive list of attributes that are ignored. But at least data attributes (e.g. data-id) and attributes with custom names (e.g. aria-labelledby) are either stripped out upon injection, or GTM might actually prevent you from even saving the container if the Custom HTML tag has elements with these attributes.</description>

      <description>First of all, check out this article for an overview of how custom event listeners work in Google Tag Manager. The reason I&amp;rsquo;m writing this #GTMTips article is that I want to upgrade the solution slightly, and I want to bring it back into the spotlight. Why? Because it&amp;rsquo;s still one of the most effective ways to customize your Google Tag Manager implementation.
A custom event listener is a handler you write with JavaScript.</description>

      <description>One of the challenges in working with Google Tag Manager (or any JavaScript-based platform for that matter) is what to do with race conditions. A race condition emerges when you have two resources competing for execution in the browser, and there is a degree of unpredictability to which &amp;ldquo;wins&amp;rdquo; the race.
A prime example is working with jQuery. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the most popular JavaScript libraries out there, and websites utilize it for a multitude of things, many useful for Google Tag Manager, too.</description>

      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/remove-pii-google-analytics-hits/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/remove-pii-google-analytics-hits/</guid>
      <description>Sending personally identifiable information (PII) to Google Analytics is one of the things you should really avoid doing. For one, it&amp;rsquo;s against the terms of service of the platform, but also you will most likely be in violation of national, federal, or EU legislation drafted to protect the privacy of individuals online.
In this #GTMTips post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you a way to make sure that any tags you configure this solution with will not contain strings that might be construed as PII.</description>

      <description>The steady increase in mobile use over the last years has introduced some new challenges for web analytics. It&amp;rsquo;s not just about mismatches in the tracking model (the concept of sessions is even more absurd for apps than it is for desktop browsing), but about something more fundamental, more basic. Think about it: if a visitor visits the website using a mobile device, there&amp;rsquo;s a significant chance of them losing internet connectivity and going unintentionally offline.</description>

      <description>More often than not, much of what we do in web analytics can be automated. This applies especially to implementations, audits, configurations, and reporting. So when I&amp;rsquo;m faced with a menial, manual task that might take hours for me to complete if done by hand, I always look at what could be done with some scripting and API work. I want to introduce a couple of Google Sheets add-ons I&amp;rsquo;ve written and released to the public.</description>

      <description>Facebook&amp;rsquo;s pixel has an attribute named content_ids (required for Dynamic Ads), which requires an Array of content IDs as its value. It&amp;rsquo;s very possible you&amp;rsquo;re running this pixel on a site which already has Enhanced Ecommerce for Universal Analytics implemented, and now you want to use the same Enhanced Ecommerce data that your developers have already made available in this Facebook pixel.
Or perhaps you want to concatenate a list of strings, such as article tags ([&#39;culture&#39;, &#39;politics&#39;]), and send it as a comma-separated string to Google Analytics (&#39;culture,politics&#39;).</description>

      <description>A couple of years ago I wrote an article on tracking interactions with the SoundCloud widget via Google Tag Manager. When a platform provides a JavaScript embed API, it&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly easy to track interactions with the player. You&amp;rsquo;ve seen this with YouTube, with SoundCloud, with JWPlayer, and now you&amp;rsquo;ll see how to do this with the Mixcloud player.
  If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Mixcloud is, well it&amp;rsquo;s a hugely popular streaming service for DJs, podcasts, radio shows, and other published radio media.</description>

      <description>One of the biggest fears I have as a Google Tag Manager user is a broken release of the website (or app) on which I have deployed GTM. Far too often, lack of proper communication practices within an organization lead to a release being pushed out without thoroughly testing how this release impacts any existing tracking solutions.
  Luckily there are ways to mitigate this. The most significant and impactful precautions you can take are all about process:</description>

      <description>I recently published a #GTMTips guide called 10 Useful CSS Selectors, and it was very well received. Inspired by the feedback, here&amp;rsquo;s the next instalment. This time, we&amp;rsquo;re going over some useful JavaScript tips and tricks that you can use to make your Google Tag Manager deployment even more efficient. I&amp;rsquo;ve written a lot about JavaScript in this blog, and I intend to keep on doing so in the future. As always, if JavaScript is somewhat of a mystery to you, I strongly recommend you take the Codecademy (free) course on JS, and take a look at the other available web technology tracks while you&amp;rsquo;re there!</description>

      <description>What better way to celebrate the 50th #GTMTips article than, well, a really useful Google Tag Manager tip?! This tip is so useful and simple; it encapsulates everything that I had in mind when starting this series. The tip is about restricting scope of Custom HTML Tags. This is an important concept, because it&amp;rsquo;s possible that you&amp;rsquo;re stuffing your page&amp;rsquo;s global JavaScript namespace with all sorts of junk, and thus inadvertently causing conflicts.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve already written extensively about JavaScript in web analytics implementation. Suffice to say, understanding at least the basics is absolutely necessary to survive in the technical medium of the web browser.
  This article expands on a conference talk I gave at MeasureCamp IX, London a short while ago. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been quite single-minded about the importance of JavaScript in web analytics development, and it was a pleasure for me to get some of that off my chest.</description>

      <description>First of all, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry about the title. I should really stop throwing the word &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; around, since people always tell me that the stuff I claim to be easy and straightforward is rarely so. But since this is my blog, I reserve the right to use whatever stupid and misleading terminology I want. I maintain that what follows IS quite simple, especially when considering the amount of complexity it reduces in your Universal Analytics setup.</description>

      <description>Back back to the friggin&amp;rsquo; basics. Almost two years ago, I wrote a two-parter on how to have fun with Google Tag Manager: Part 1, and Part 2. The first part had a nice exercise for tracking JavaScript Errors as Google Analytics Events, using the recently published &amp;ldquo;JavaScript Error Listener&amp;rdquo; Tag.
Well, that was in GTM V1. Now we&amp;rsquo;ve been smoothly sailing with the wonderful new interface for well over a year, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to update some of these nifty tricks.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately, iFrames still exist. They are used to embed content from one page into another. Frames are horrible, nasty things, very often riddled with cross-domain problems, performance issues, responsive design obstructions and other crap from the nether pits of hell. Regardless, if you&amp;rsquo;re stuck with an iFrame which also collects data to your Google Analytics property, for example, you probably want to prevent at least the first Page View from firing, since otherwise you&amp;rsquo;ll be double-counting Page Views: once on the main page and once in the iFrame.</description>

      <description>There are many tools and methods to make Google Analytics more manageable. Google Tag Manager is probably the best known of these, and you can find many, many articles about GTM on these pages as well.
However, today I want to tell you about one of the features of Universal Analytics that hasn&amp;rsquo;t, as far as I know, received too much attention. It&amp;rsquo;s funny, because at the same time almost everyone uses the feature in the shape of eCommerce, enhanced link attribution, and cross-domain tracking.</description>

      <description>In 2013, I wrote a guide for Universal Analytics and Google Tag Manager on how to poll for weather conditions, and send this information to Google Analytics as a custom dimension of the session. The guide was intended as a technical introduction to Google Tag Manager, and I think it succeeded in that.
However, GTM has changed a lot over the last 1.5 years, and I&amp;rsquo;ve made some improvements to the method along the way.</description>

      <description>This nifty little solution will let you calculate the time spent on pages that are not tracked in Google Analytics by default. These include both bounced landing pages and exit pages. Bounced pages and exit pages lack the necessary subsequent pageview, which Google Analytics uses to calculate time-based metrics.

      <description>One of the big mysteries in browser-based data collection platforms like Google Analytics is what happens when the visitor is not being tracked. This is most obvious in cases where the user explicitly opts out of tracking, when the user does not have JavaScript active in their browser, in bounced sessions, and on exit pages.
Opt-outing means that the user explicitly prohibits a website from tracking them. In some cases, it&amp;rsquo;s possible that opt-out is the default, and the user must explicitly opt-in to allow GA to record their visits.</description>

      <title>Use Page Visibility API With GTM</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/use-page-visibility-api-google-tag-manager/</link>

      <description>The Page Visibility API for web browsers is pretty sweet. It lets you poll, using some new properties of the document object, whether or not the current page is visible to the user. Visibility is hidden if the page is not open in the current browser tab instance, or if the browser window has been minimized.
  In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll give an example of how features of the Page Visibility API could be used with Google Tag Manager.</description>

      <description>This might not sound like a tip to you. You might think, &amp;ldquo;Dimensions won&amp;rsquo;t get sent? Sounds like a bug!&amp;rdquo;. You&amp;rsquo;re wrong. This is one of the awesome features of the GA API, and it&amp;rsquo;s key to making your tag setups leaner when sending data to Google Analytics.
Tip 4: Undefined dimensions are left out of GA hits   Note that &amp;lsquo;undefined&amp;rsquo; here means the special value undefined in JavaScript.</description>

      <title>Persist dataLayer In Google Tag Manager</title>

      <description>(Update 19 November 2018: See this article for a more elegant solution.)
If you know your JavaScript, you know that all variables, functions, objects, resources, and data in the document get rewritten with every page load. In other words, every single page refresh builds the page from scratch, and the state of the document before the page refresh is left drifting in the ocean of oblivion.
Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s dataLayer is also one such entity.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a much easier, native-to-GTM way to do this now: the Matches CSS Selector.
Behind this tragically boring title is a simple solution to many problems with Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s auto-event tracking. The common denominator to these problems is poor website markup. Selectors are used sparingly, and element hierarchy is messy. This disregard for proper node relationships means you have to resort to Data Layer Variable Macros which look like</description>

      <title>Custom Event Listeners For GTM</title>

      <description>(UPDATE 1 Oct 2014 Due to a change in how macros work in Debug Mode, the {{generic event handler}} macro no longer works when testing in Debug Mode. That means that you&amp;rsquo;ll have to test your custom listener in a live container (I know, ouch!). If you want to test in Debug Mode, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to skip using the {{generic event handler}} as a macro, and instead copy the inner function into the Custom HTML Tag, give the function a name, and use that as the callback in addEventListener or attachEvent.</description>

The heat has given me ample reason to not be near a computer, but now it&amp;rsquo;s time to mine some JavaScript wisdom again. Here&amp;rsquo;s the second part of my JavaScript for Google Tag Manager series. The first part focused on GTM specific tips and tricks, and I hope that while reading it, you were treated to another grand example of the flexibility of this wonderful tool.</description>

      <description>I created a new Chrome Extension: Internalize for Google Analytics. This is its very first version. It only works on websites with Universal Analytics.
Click here to download Internalize for Google Analytics v1.0
The idea is that with the extension you can push a custom dimension value to your currently active session. You can then use a profile filter in GA to block traffic with this custom dimension value. It&amp;rsquo;s useful when blocking internal traffic with more traditional means (IP address or various GTM workarounds) won&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

      <description>Analyzing what people write in your site search field is pretty much one of the smartest things you can do for your website tracking. If certain terms pop up over and over again in internal search reports, it means that your site is not providing the answers people are looking for, meaning you have an excellent opportunity to provide supply for the demand!
  However, not all site search applications are trackable out-of-the-box.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the link to part 2 of this JavaScript guide.
The thing about Google Tag Manager, or any JavaScript tag manager for that matter, is that there&amp;rsquo;s JavaScript involved. In fact, the tool itself is just a JavaScript library with some additional bells and whistles (such as a management UI). This means that to make the best of it, some knowledge of JavaScript is warranted, and that&amp;rsquo;s the point of this post.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to set up a rudimentary email alert system in your Google Tag Manager implementation. Say, for example, you want to receive an email every time an uncaught error occurs on your website. It&amp;rsquo;s not a very good use case, since a large website can spawn hundreds of uncaught exceptions in a short period of time, but let&amp;rsquo;s just pretend for now.
If you know your JavaScript, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that you can&amp;rsquo;t send mail using client-side code.</description>

      <description>First of all, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for the wacky title. Sometimes I just want to amuse myself. Nevertheless, this post is about the Google Tag Manager container snippet. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing secretive about it, but I&amp;rsquo;m betting many people have no clue what the snippet really does. That&amp;rsquo;s the revelatory part.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve never wondered what the snippet does, then shame on you! Remember, you own your page template. It&amp;rsquo;s yours. Any code that you write there is your responsibility.</description>

      <description>Ever so often I come across a Google Tag Manager setup where GTM&amp;rsquo;s own auto-event listeners don&amp;rsquo;t perform the task they were supposed to. Listener problems seem to be a hot topic in Google+ and the Product Forums as well.
There may be many reasons why your listeners don&amp;rsquo;t work, but a very common trend is that you have conflicting JavaScript libraries or scripts running on your page.
Let&amp;rsquo;s explore how listeners work before tackling the problem.</description>

While going over my previous post about using weather conditions to segment data in Google Analytics, I started thinking about performance issues. Since I&amp;rsquo;m using a visit-scope custom dimension, it seems futile to have it send the weather details with every single page load. The odds of the weather changing drastically during one visit are slim (unless you live in the UK), and I have yet to come up with a good reason to change my on-site behavior because the weather changed from a drizzle to a downpour.</description>

A couple of weeks ago, I checked one of our (inactive) client&amp;rsquo;s Google Analytics accounts I still had access to. What I saw in the acquisition report was this:

[Last updated June 2014] I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen in love with Universal Analytics and Google Tag Manager. Together they form an incredibly powerful tool for marketing professionals. In most cases, I no longer need to post recommendations to my client for yet another page template revision, since with the tag manager in place, I can just add custom code via the admin panel.</description>
