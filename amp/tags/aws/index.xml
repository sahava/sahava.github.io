&lt;p>I personally prefer &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform&lt;/a> over AWS, because I think it&amp;rsquo;s so much more user-friendly. Even though in this guide we&amp;rsquo;ll be utilizing one of the simplest AWS services, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">Elastic Beanstalk&lt;/a>, the deployment is still &lt;em>much&lt;/em> more complex than if you were to use GCP&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine">App Engine&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Snowplow: Full Setup With Google Analytics Tracking</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/snowplow-full-setup-with-google-analytics-tracking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2018 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/snowplow-full-setup-with-google-analytics-tracking/</guid><description>&lt;p>A &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/automatically-fork-google-analytics-hits-snowplow/">recent guide&lt;/a> of mine introduced the &lt;a href="https://snowplowanalytics.com/blog/2018/01/25/snowplow-r99-carnac-with-google-analytics-support/">Google Analytics adapter&lt;/a> in &lt;a href="https://snowplowanalytics.com/">Snowplow&lt;/a>. The idea was that you can duplicate the &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics&lt;/a> requests sent via &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> and dispatch them to your Snowplow analytics pipeline, too. The pipeline then takes care of these duplicated requests, using the new adapter to automatically align the hits with their corresponding data tables, ready for data modeling and analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While testing the new adapter, I implemented a Snowplow pipeline from scratch for parsing data from my own website. This was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d done the whole process from end-to-end myself, so I thought it might be prudent to document the process for the benefit of others who might want to take a jab at Snowplow but are intimidated by the moving parts.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
