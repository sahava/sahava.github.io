      <description>Updated 5 March 2019 with additional solutions.
 On 21st February 2019, WebKit announced the release of the latest iteration of Safari&amp;rsquo;s Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP), known as ITP 2.1. For a while now, Safari has been targeting cross-site tracking with ITP, first starting with cookies in third-party contexts, then tightening the noose after a number of workarounds emerged, and finally with the latest iteration targeting cookies that were moved from a third-party context to a first-party context.</description>

      <description>Looks like Safari is tightening the noose around browser cookies with the introduction of ITP 2.1 (Intelligent Tracking Prevention). Among other things, ITP 2.1 caps the expiration of client-side cookies to 7 days. Client-side cookies in this context refer to cookies set with the document.cookie API, which would cover pretty much all cookies set by vendored JavaScript libraries like Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; analytics.js.
Personally, I think anything that forces a rethink of the cookie model is welcome.</description>
