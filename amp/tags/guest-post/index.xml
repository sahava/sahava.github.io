He is a prolific content creator, and he curates the &lt;a href="https://dumbdata.co/">DumbData&lt;/a> portal, which is full of great, free resources for measurement enthusiasts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, he shares some useful learnings for working with &lt;strong>click identifiers&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Click IDs are URL parameters used by ad platforms. They are attached to outgoing links (ad clicks), so that when the user lands on a website, the URL would include this identifier. Pixels and scripts that then run on the landing page can take this identifier and forward it to the vendor, who can then correlate behavior on the landing page with the ad that was clicked.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Track And Categorize All Link Clicks On The Site With Google Analytics 4</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-and-categorize-all-link-clicks-on-the-site/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 07:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-and-categorize-all-link-clicks-on-the-site/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>You know the deal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each and every day, clients reach out to you asking for &lt;strong>custom click tracking&lt;/strong> for this call-to-action on that slider, or that button in this section of a page. They reach out to you because such things cannot be answered out of the box in &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics 4&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DIY Google Ads Account Monitor With R, AdWords API, And Slack API</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/web-development/monitor-google-ads-accounts-r-adwords-api-slack-api/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2019 09:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/web-development/monitor-google-ads-accounts-r-adwords-api-slack-api/</guid><description>&lt;p>Every now and then I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate enough to be able to publish &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/tags/guest-post/">guest posts&lt;/a> by illustrious people in the analytics and digital marketing industries. This time, I get to work with an old colleague of mine who&amp;rsquo;s a veritable wizard when it comes to building solutions that make our daily work in the digital industry so much smoother.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Erik Grönroos&lt;/strong> works as an analyst in &lt;a href="https://markkinointiakatemia.fi/">MarkkinointiAkatemia&lt;/a>, a Finnish digital customer acquisition agency.

It&amp;rsquo;s not just about mismatches in the tracking model (the concept of &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/the-schema-conspiracy/">&lt;em>sessions&lt;/em>&lt;/a> is even more absurd for apps than it is for desktop browsing), but about something more fundamental, more basic. Think about it: if a visitor visits the website using a mobile device, there&amp;rsquo;s a significant chance of them losing internet connectivity and going unintentionally offline.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google Analytics Client ID In AMP Pages</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-analytics-client-id-amp-pages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2016 08:59:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-analytics-client-id-amp-pages/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article is a collaboration between Simo and &lt;a href="https://www.bounteous.com/insights/author/danwilkerson/">Dan Wilkerson&lt;/a>. Dan&amp;rsquo;s one of the smartest analytics developers out there, and he&amp;rsquo;s already contributed a great &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/using-document-write-safely-gtm-tags/">#GTMTips guest post&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s great to have him back here sharing his insight on working with &lt;a href="https://www.ampproject.org/">Accelerated Mobile Pages&lt;/a> (AMP).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we&amp;rsquo;re back on AMP! Simo wrote a long, sprawling &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/accelerated-mobile-pages-via-google-tag-manager/">AMP for Google Tag Manager guide&lt;/a> a while ago, and Dan has also contributed to the space with his guide for &lt;a href="https://www.bounteous.com/insights/2015/12/08/google-analytics-using-amp/">AMP and Google Analytics&lt;/a>. Both of these guides touched upon a subject that might be one of the reasons to stay away from AMP for now: Client ID matching across AMP, your regular website, and any caches or CDNs that serve the AMP version.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introducing GA Spy For Google Analytics</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/introducing-ga-spy-for-google-analytics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2016 10:16:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/introducing-ga-spy-for-google-analytics/</guid><description>&lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/images/2016/09/stephen-harris.jpg" title="Stephen Harris (c) Seer Interactive">

&lt;p>If &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> is loaded as the primary instrument for tracking on a webpage (as it should be), then all webpage tracking could and should be configurable via GTM. But we don&amp;rsquo;t always control the circumstances, and it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to face hardcoded &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics&lt;/a> tracking outside of GTM.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#GTMTips: Using document.write Safely In GTM Tags</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/using-document-write-safely-gtm-tags/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2016 07:25:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/using-document-write-safely-gtm-tags/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article is a guest article by someone from the analytics community I really look up to. &lt;a href="https://www.bounteous.com/insights/author/danwilkerson/">Dan Wilkerson&lt;/a> is an analytics developer at &lt;a href="https://www.bounteous.com/">Bounteous&lt;/a>, a company I hold in high esteem. Dan is one of the smartest technical analytics experts out there, and a large bulk of the awesome scripts and hacks that Bounteous produces (almost on a daily basis) have been orchestrated by him. So I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased to give the floor to Dan, so that he can tell you all about using the pesky &lt;code>document.write()&lt;/code> method in your &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> Custom HTML Tags!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Firing A Single Tag Multiple Times In GTM</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/firing-a-single-tag-multiple-times-in-gtm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2015 07:40:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/firing-a-single-tag-multiple-times-in-gtm/</guid><description>&lt;p>There might be many reasons you&amp;rsquo;d want to fire a single Tag multiple times in &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>. The most common one is when you want to deploy multiples of a single tracking point on the web. Perhaps you have a roll-up account you want to send the hits to, in addition to the site-specific tracking property.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quite a while ago, I &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/fun-google-tag-manager-part-2/">gave a solution for this&lt;/a> with a specific focus on &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics&lt;/a> Tags. It leveraged the &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/hitcallback-eventcallback/">hitCallback&lt;/a> feature of the Universal Analytics library by increasing a global counter each time a Tag had fired. This solution had a number of drawbacks: being GA-specific, polluting the global namespace, and requiring a unique setup for every single Tag you wanted to fire.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
