      <title>#GTMTips: Edit Google Analytics Tag Settings</title>

      <description>When the Google Analytics Settings variable was introduced in May 2017, it resulted in a significant change in the Google Analytics tag user interface in Google Tag Manager. The default UI for editing a tag was stripped down of all GA-specific settings, and the new Google Analytics Settings drop-down was the replacement.
Unfortunately, the bulk of Google Tag Manager articles online (including those on this blog) still refer to the old interface in screenshots and instructions.</description>

      <title>Google Analytics Settings Variable In GTM</title>

      <description>Let&#39;s face it - most of us use Google Tag Manager for one main purpose: to deploy and configure Google Analytics tracking on a website. I&#39;d wager that once you start using GTM, you won&#39;t be implementing Universal Analytics the old-fashioned way, with on-page code, any more. But running Universal Analytics tags through GTM isn&#39;t yet a perfect workflow. We&#39;re still missing things like proper plugin support and the option to properly differentiate between the tracker and the hit - both of which are easy to do with an on-page implementation.</description>
