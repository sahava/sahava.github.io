&lt;p>As I have finally managed to pick up my jaw from the floor, it&amp;rsquo;s now time to tell you what&amp;rsquo;s got me so excited. &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> recently released a new feature called &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/templates/">&lt;strong>Custom Templates&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. Actually, it&amp;rsquo;s not fair to call it a &lt;em>feature&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s a full-blown paradigm shift in how we use Google Tag Manager. It&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em>suite&lt;/em> of features designed to help brands, companies, and users create and share their own custom JavaScript and HTML setups with ease, while taking care that the code is optimized for delivery in the web browser.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CSS Selector Guide For Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/css-selector-guide-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2019 09:55:23 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/css-selector-guide-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>Some four years ago, &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/matches-css-selector-operator-in-gtm-triggers/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> released a new &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/trigger-guide-google-tag-manager/">trigger&lt;/a> predicate named &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/matches-css-selector-operator-in-gtm-triggers/">&lt;strong>matches CSS selector&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. Slowly but surely, it has evolved into one of &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/10-useful-css-selectors/">the most useful&lt;/a> little features in GTM.&lt;/p>

 &lt;/a>
 

&lt;p>Even though I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/tags/css-selectors/">written&lt;/a> about CSS selectors many times before, I wanted to compile all the relevant information into a single guide. For an external resource, I recommend bookmarking the &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp">w3schools.com CSS Selector Reference&lt;/a>. But for your day-to-day use of CSS selectors in GTM, this guide will hopefully prove useful.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enhanced Ecommerce Guide For Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-guide-for-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Sep 2018 08:35:17 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-guide-for-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/enhanced-ecommerce">Enhanced Ecommerce&lt;/a> is certainly one of the finest reporting user interface features that &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics&lt;/a> has to offer. Enhanced Ecommerce, as the name implies, is a set of dimensions, metrics, and reports, which combine to provide you with a fairly complete view into how users are interacting with your products in your webstore. The main downside of Enhanced Ecommerce is, as with all good things, that it&amp;rsquo;s complicated to implement.&lt;/p>

 &lt;/a>
 

&lt;p>Luckily, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>. Theoretically, you could implement Enhanced Ecommerce through Google Tag Manager without ever adding a single line of functional logic into the codebase of your web site. You could do everything by simply &lt;a href="#a-word-on-scraping-the-dom">&lt;em>scraping&lt;/em> the Document Object Model&lt;/a> (DOM). However, as we have hopefully learned over the years - GTM is a tool with which fastidiousness trumps fast.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Guide To Zones In Google Tag Manager 360</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/guide-zones-google-tag-manager-360/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Mar 2018 23:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/guide-zones-google-tag-manager-360/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> supports loading &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/multiple-gtm-containers-on-the-page/">multiple containers&lt;/a> on the same page. It&amp;rsquo;s useful if you have multiple companies or organizations working on the same site, but for one reason or another (e.g. governance) you want to restrict access to your main container. In these situations, having the other party create their own container and adding it to the site is the best of bad options.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Scroll Depth Trigger In Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/scroll-depth-trigger-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2017 19:11:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/scroll-depth-trigger-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>Scroll depth tracking in web analytics is one of those things you simply &lt;strong>must&lt;/strong> do, especially if you have a content-heavy site. Tracking scroll depth not only gives you an indication of how much users are digesting your content, but it also lets you turn meaningless metrics such as Bounce Rate into something far more useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve already been tracking scroll depth in &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably been using either Rob Flaherty&amp;rsquo;s brilliant &lt;a href="http://scrolldepth.parsnip.io/">Scroll Depth&lt;/a> jQuery plugin, or Bounteous&amp;rsquo; equally ingenious &lt;a href="https://www.bounteous.com/labs/recipes/scroll-tracking/">Scroll Tracking recipe&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ll be very pleased to know that Google Tag Manager just released a &lt;strong>native Scroll Depth trigger&lt;/strong>, with which setting up scroll depth tracking will be a doozy!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The RegEx Table Variable In Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/the-regex-table-variable-in-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2017 21:29:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/the-regex-table-variable-in-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ever since the &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-tag-manager-lookup-table-macro/">Lookup Table variable was introduced&lt;/a> in &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>, users have been craving for more. The Lookup Table does exactly what it promises: lookups. These are exact match operations, which are extremely inexpensive to perform, because they can only have a binary result: either the match exists in the data store being queried or it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. This performance stays constant even if the data store being queried increases in size. However, exact match has one significant problem: it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong>exact&lt;/strong> match. Thus even though the Lookup Table variable is extremely useful, it&amp;rsquo;s missing the flexibility of, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, say, regular expressions. You will be pleased to hear, then, that Google Tag Manager has released a new variable type: the &lt;strong>RegEx Table&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#GTMTips: The Timer Trigger</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/timer-trigger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2016 10:02:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/timer-trigger/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> has a &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/trigger-guide-google-tag-manager/">Trigger&lt;/a> type which fires after a certain duration of time has passed on the web page: the Timer Trigger. The most common uses for the Timer Trigger seem to be either to send an event to Google Analytics after X seconds of dwell time (to kill the Bounce), or to defer a Tag from firing until some asynchronous request has completed with certainty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the previous version of Google Tag Manager, the Timer was a separate listener Tag, which meant that you could start a timer based on a user interaction such as a click. In the current version of GTM, this is no longer possible, as the Timer Trigger will only start when GTM is first loaded on the page. So, one of the tips in this article will be how create your own Timer, in case you want to start one based on some other stimulus than the Page View.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#GTMTips: 10 Blogs, 10 Articles, 10 People To Follow</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/gtmtips-10-blogs-10-articles-10-people-follow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2016 15:11:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/gtmtips-10-blogs-10-articles-10-people-follow/</guid><description>&lt;p>Quite a while ago, I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/awesome-google-tag-manager-resources/">an article&lt;/a> on what I considered (then) to be my favorite &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> resources. Many of them are still very valid, but I still wanted to write a follow-up. Times have changed, and GTM is very different from what it was two years ago when I wrote the post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So in this article, I want to divert your attention to 10 blogs, 10 articles, and 10 people - all which are and/or share excellent Google Tag Manager content on a periodic basis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#GTMTips: URL Source In The URL Variable</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/url-source-in-the-url-variable/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2015 07:53:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/url-source-in-the-url-variable/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the less-known features of &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>, a hidden gem if you will, is the &lt;strong>URL Source&lt;/strong> setting in the &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/variable-guide-google-tag-manager/">URL Variable&lt;/a> type. It lets you parse &lt;em>any&lt;/em> URL String for its components.&lt;/p>

 &lt;/a>
 

&lt;p>The setting itself is easy to find. Just edit an existing &lt;strong>URL&lt;/strong> Variable, or create a new one. Then, scroll down to the &lt;strong>More Settings&lt;/strong> divider, expand it, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see the &lt;strong>URL Source&lt;/strong> drop-down list.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Firing A Single Tag Multiple Times In GTM</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/firing-a-single-tag-multiple-times-in-gtm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2015 07:40:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/firing-a-single-tag-multiple-times-in-gtm/</guid><description>&lt;p>There might be many reasons you&amp;rsquo;d want to fire a single Tag multiple times in &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>. The most common one is when you want to deploy multiples of a single tracking point on the web. Perhaps you have a roll-up account you want to send the hits to, in addition to the site-specific tracking property.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quite a while ago, I &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/fun-google-tag-manager-part-2/">gave a solution for this&lt;/a> with a specific focus on &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics&lt;/a> Tags. It leveraged the &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/hitcallback-eventcallback/">hitCallback&lt;/a> feature of the Universal Analytics library by increasing a global counter each time a Tag had fired. This solution had a number of drawbacks: being GA-specific, polluting the global namespace, and requiring a unique setup for every single Tag you wanted to fire.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#GTMTips: Referral Exclusion On Receipt Page</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/referral-exclusion-on-receipt-page/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2015 07:27:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/referral-exclusion-on-receipt-page/</guid><description>&lt;p>You might have noticed that the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2795830?hl=en">Referral Exclusion List&lt;/a> in &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics&lt;/a> is difficult to maintain. You can&amp;rsquo;t copy a list from one property to another, the list is a wildcard match for domain names (so all subdomains are automatically excluded), and it&amp;rsquo;s just about the clunkiest user interface we&amp;rsquo;ve seen since ERP tools from the 1990s. A while ago, I &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/implement-referral-exclusions-via-gtm/">wrote of a solution&lt;/a> which lets you manage referral exclusions using &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>, and it&amp;rsquo;s still a neat trick, as it&amp;rsquo;s way more flexible than said clunky UI.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Better QA With Google Tag Manager Environments</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/better-qa-with-google-tag-manager-environments/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2015 05:14:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/better-qa-with-google-tag-manager-environments/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>, our favorite free tag management solution, has always struggled with its enterprise-worthiness. There are many features still lacking, most of which have to do with working in multi-user environments. Now, grab the last word of that sentence (see what I did there), and hug it tightly, for GTM just introduced a new, enterprise-friendly feature: &lt;strong>Environments&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>


 &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/images/2015/11/publish-to-qa.jpg" title="Publish to QA">

 &lt;/a>
 

&lt;p>These &lt;em>Environments&lt;/em> are actually browser cookies, which you use to link a Google Tag Manager container &lt;strong>state&lt;/strong> with the browser of the user who needs to or wants to view that particular state. In other words, if you have a QA (quality assurance) process, as you should have, or if you do most of your testing on a staging server, as you should do, you can create an &lt;em>Environment&lt;/em> in GTM, after which you can publish container versions (even the draft) into that particular Environment alone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Iframe Cross-Domain Tracking In Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/iframe-cross-domain-tracking-in-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2015 10:16:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/iframe-cross-domain-tracking-in-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>NOTE!&lt;/strong> This solution has been upgraded, and the new approach can be found &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/tracking-cross-domain-iframes-upgraded-solution/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with the lingo, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1034342?hl=en">cross-domain tracking&lt;/a> is a hack used by &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics&lt;/a> to circumvent the web browser&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">same-origin policy&lt;/a>. Essentially, the policy dictates that browser cookies can only be shared with a parent domain and all its sub-domains. In other words, &lt;strong>domainA.com&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>domainB.com&lt;/strong> do not share cookies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since Google Analytics calculates sessions and users by using a cookie, this is problematic. If the user navigates from domainA.com to domainB.com, they will, by default, browse domainB.com in a different session (often a different user as well) from that on domainA.com.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Setup Google Tag Manager iOS With Swift</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/setup-google-tag-manager-ios-with-swift/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2015 12:16:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/setup-google-tag-manager-ios-with-swift/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write about &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> for &lt;strong>mobile apps&lt;/strong> for such a long time. Finally, I have some great use cases to share, as well as some useful examples for implementing &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/ios/v3/">GTM for iOS&lt;/a>. That&amp;rsquo;s right, this is an &lt;strong>iOS&lt;/strong> guide, and, to be more specific, geared towards a successful &lt;strong>Swift&lt;/strong> implementation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you didn&amp;rsquo;t know, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift&lt;/a> is a relatively new programming language, developed by Apple for iOS and OS X programming. It&amp;rsquo;s got some nice synergies with existing Objective-C implementations, which means you can either gradually migrate to Swift, or just start writing new apps with it instantly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Measure Ad And Content Blocker Impact</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/measure-ad-content-blocker-impact-on-traffic/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2015 08:52:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/measure-ad-content-blocker-impact-on-traffic/</guid><description>&lt;p>So, looks like iOS 9 has built-in support for integrating &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=511">content blocking&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; extensions on your iPhone. Now, blocking ads and other intrusive content is nothing new, nor do I want to get into a debate about whether it&amp;rsquo;s a good thing or not. But as a data geek I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in knowing just what share of my site tracking has some content blocker enabled. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show two tricks (easy and advanced) to expose these content blockers. It&amp;rsquo;s always a good idea to keep tabs on the numbers, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re concerned about them blocking your analytics tools as well (as you should be!).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Measure SERP Bounce Time With GTM</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/measure-serp-bounce-time-with-gtm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2015 12:28:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/measure-serp-bounce-time-with-gtm/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s an interesting and hacky use case for you. It&amp;rsquo;s all about uncovering &lt;strong>bounce&lt;/strong> metrics for visits which originate from organic Google search results. In particular, the metric we&amp;rsquo;re interested in is how long user &lt;em>dwelled&lt;/em> on the landing page after arriving from organic Google search &lt;strong>AND&lt;/strong> returned to the search engine results page (SERP) using the browser&amp;rsquo;s back button.&lt;/p>

 &lt;/a>
 

&lt;p>The inspiration for this post came from an audience question at the Best Internet Conference in Lithuania, which I recently attended as a speaker. They were concerned that Google is using Bounce Rate as a search ranking signal, and I was fairly strongly opinionated that it&amp;rsquo;s simply not possible, as all the &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; GA metrics are really easy to manipulate. However, Dr. Pete from Moz wrote about &lt;a href="https://moz.com/blog/the-2-user-metrics-that-matter-for-seo">&lt;em>dwell time&lt;/em>&lt;/a> in 2012, and it makes a lot of sense. Google should be &lt;strong>very&lt;/strong> interested how long the visitor stays out of the SERP when following a link. If users tend to immediately return to the SERP, it&amp;rsquo;s very likely the result was not relevant for them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#GTMTips: Check For New User</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/check-for-new-user/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2015 11:13:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/check-for-new-user/</guid><description>&lt;p>Every now and then we want to create a bridge between the stateful machines we send data to (e.g. &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics&lt;/a>), and the stateless environment where we collect the data itself (e.g. &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>). This &lt;em>is not easy&lt;/em>. There is no synergy between Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager which would let the latter understand anything about things like &lt;em>sessions&lt;/em> or &lt;em>landing pages&lt;/em> or &lt;em>Bounce Rates&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing we can reliably measure, however, is whether or not the visitor is a &lt;strong>New User&lt;/strong> in Google Analytics. This is done by checking whether or not the Universal Analytics cookie &lt;code>_ga&lt;/code> exists in the user&amp;rsquo;s browser when they enter the site. Naturally, this check needs to happen before the Universal Analytics Tag has time to create the cookie, which is the only difficult thing to solve here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enhanced Ecommerce Tips And Learnings</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-tips-and-learnings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2015 07:55:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-tips-and-learnings/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/enhanced-ecommerce">Enhanced Ecommerce&lt;/a> is undoubtedly an excellent feature of &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>However, here&amp;rsquo;s the thing. It&amp;rsquo;s not very easy to implement. Even if you get everything right according to the documentation, there are still quite a number of pitfalls, and many of the learnings emerge only through experience. This is where I want to help out, so I composed this post with some of my key findings about Enhanced Ecommerce implementation and use.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Track Form Engagement With Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-form-engagement-with-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 07:56:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-form-engagement-with-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>(Updated 13 August 2017)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A little over a year ago, in April 2014, I wrote the post &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/form-tracking-google-tag-manager/">Advanced Form Tracking In Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, and it&amp;rsquo;s been at the top of my best seller list ever since. Turns out that many people are rightfully passionate about making the web forms on their websites as fluid and intuitive as possible, since a web form is often the only thing that stands between a prospect and their transformation into clienthood.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding Tag Sequencing In Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/understanding-tag-sequencing-in-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2015 06:18:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/understanding-tag-sequencing-in-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>A recent update to &lt;a href="http://tagmanager.google.com">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> introduced a feature which has been on the wishlist of many users for a long time. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;strong>Tag sequencing&lt;/strong>, and its purpose is to facilitate the sequential firing of Tags. The idea is that you can specify a &lt;strong>setup&lt;/strong> and a &lt;strong>cleanup&lt;/strong> for each Tag in your container.&lt;/p>

 &lt;/a>
 

&lt;p>This article is intended to function as a quick tour of the feature. It&amp;rsquo;s not the simplest feature to understand, as Tag sequencing runs parallel but separate from the normal flow of your container. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to this soon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Two Ways To Persist Data Via Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/two-ways-to-persist-data-via-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2015 15:30:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/two-ways-to-persist-data-via-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>The web is stateless. It&amp;rsquo;s basically blind to your past, and it does a poor job of predicting what you might do in the future. When you browse to a website, the browser requests the page from the web server, and then proceeds to render it for you. This is a detached, clinical process, and any &lt;em>personalized&lt;/em> or &lt;em>stateful&lt;/em> data transfer is left to the sophistication of your web server.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#GTMTips: Block Your Tags With Trigger Exceptions</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/block-your-tags-with-trigger-exceptions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2015 09:54:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/block-your-tags-with-trigger-exceptions/</guid><description>&lt;p>To prevent a Tag from firing in &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>, you can:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Delete the Tag&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Remove all Triggers from the Tag&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Add an &lt;strong>Exception&lt;/strong> Trigger to the Tag&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The third option is usually the best if the blocking is just temporary. Exceptions are what used to be called &lt;em>blocking rules&lt;/em> in the first version of GTM. To add them is easy enough. In the &lt;strong>Fire On&lt;/strong> step of Tag creation, you can click &lt;strong>Create Exceptions&lt;/strong>, and choose the Trigger that will block this Tag from firing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Form Field Timing With Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/form-field-timing-with-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2015 09:33:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/form-field-timing-with-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>The inimitable &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/optimiseordie">Craig Sullivan&lt;/a> gave me an idea for a continuation to my &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-form-abandonment-with-google-tag-manager/">latest post on form abandonment tracking&lt;/a>. In this short tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to track the time users spend on your form fields. We&amp;rsquo;re going to use the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/user-timings">User Timings&lt;/a> hit type, and we&amp;rsquo;ll send the data for just one form. With small modifications, you can expand the script to cover multiple forms on a page.&lt;/p>

 &lt;/a>
 

&lt;p>This simple solution tracks the time the user spends on each form field by measuring the distance between the &lt;code>focus&lt;/code> event and the &lt;code>blur&lt;/code> or &lt;code>change&lt;/code> event. The first one occurs when a form field is entered, and the latter depends on if a value changed (&lt;code>change&lt;/code>) or no change was registered (&lt;code>blur&lt;/code>).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Track Form Abandonment With Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-form-abandonment-with-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2015 08:12:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-form-abandonment-with-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Form abandonment&lt;/strong> isn&amp;rsquo;t always easy to define. Most often, it refers to when someone starts to fill in an HTML form, but leaves the page without submitting it. As a definition, this works nicely. However, with multi-page forms it naturally refers only to the &lt;em>last&lt;/em> page of the form. Also, especially with government institutions, forms can be saved to be submitted later. Here, again, &lt;em>form abandonment&lt;/em> must be reconsidered.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll go over &lt;strong>four&lt;/strong> different ways to track form abandonment in &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics&lt;/a>, using &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> to setup the tracking. The definition I&amp;rsquo;ll use is the first one: abandonment occurs when someone enters a form page, but leaves it without submitting the form. Do note that GA might not be the right tool to actually track issues with your form. There are dedicated resources for that, such as &lt;a href="http://www.clicktale.com">ClickTale&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="http://www.hotjar.com">Hotjar&lt;/a>. But if you want to measure form engagement as part of a more coherent visitor journey, then it might make sense to track this engagement (or lack thereof) in Google Analytics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enhanced Ecommerce With A Custom JavaScript Variable</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-with-a-custom-javascript-variable/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2015 08:15:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-with-a-custom-javascript-variable/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/enhanced-ecommerce">Enhanced Ecommerce&lt;/a> is a very nice improvement to the pretty lame, &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/ecommerce">transaction-based Ecommerce&lt;/a> tracking in Universal Analytics.

 &lt;/a>
 

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a &lt;strong>lot&lt;/strong> of containers that suffer from the same problem. They have many Event tags which only differ by the &lt;em>Event&lt;/em> that triggers them and/or by the tag fields of &lt;em>Event Category / Action / Label / Value&lt;/em>. There&amp;rsquo;s an easy way to reduce redundancy here.

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://analytics.blogspot.fi/2014/10/making-tag-management-more-accessible.html">current version&lt;/a> of &lt;a href="http://tagmanager.google.com">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> was released in October 2014. With the release, we saw a brand-spanking new UI, a lot of new functionalities (revamped &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/auto-event-tracking-gtm-2-0/">auto-event tracking&lt;/a>, for example), plus a new terminology to cope with. We moved away from the programming-centric concepts of &lt;em>Macros&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Rules&lt;/em> to the more tactile &lt;em>variables&lt;/em> and &lt;em>triggers&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to rank the changes. The new &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/auto-event-tracking-gtm-2-0/">Auto-Event Tracking&lt;/a> is perhaps most impactful, but the improvements done to triggers and variables, when compared to the previous version of GTM, require attention as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Track Content With Enhanced Ecommerce</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-content-enhanced-ecommerce/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2014 12:18:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-content-enhanced-ecommerce/</guid><description>&lt;p>My fingers have been tingling to write this article.

&lt;p>In &lt;a href="http://analytics.blogspot.fi/2014/10/making-tag-management-more-accessible.html">the new version&lt;/a> of &lt;a href="http://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>, one of the most visible and profound changes to the previous version is how tags are fired (and blocked). First of all, there&amp;rsquo;s the obvious terminological distinction: we talk about &lt;strong>triggers&lt;/strong> now, not &lt;em>rules&lt;/em>. Second, triggers have become an integral part of the tag creation workflow, and as such have far more significance in the user interface than before.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The following text is a standalone article. It&amp;rsquo;s not an update to the guide I wrote for the previous GTM version: &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-tag-manager-playing-rules/">Google Tag Manager: Playing By The Rules&lt;/a>, and many of the concepts covered therein are still valid.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Check If Google Analytics Is In The Page Template</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/check-if-google-analytics-is-in-page-template/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2014 08:33:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/check-if-google-analytics-is-in-page-template/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the recurring problems in migrating to Google Tag Manager is how to make the transition as smooth as possible. Usually it requires that we agree with the developers on a time when the old code is removed, and at that moment we need to make sure the GTM tags point to the right UA code. This is, of course, only one use case for migrations, as some people do the entire migration in a staging environment, and some just don&amp;rsquo;t care if they lose a little bit of data along the way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Simple RegEx Table For Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/simple-regex-lookup-table-for-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2014 11:57:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/simple-regex-lookup-table-for-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>When our good friends in the &lt;a href="http://tagmanager.google.com">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> developer team first introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-tag-manager-lookup-table-macro/">Lookup Table Macro&lt;/a>, we were excited.

 &lt;/a>
 

&lt;p>However, the macro wasn&amp;rsquo;t considered perfect. In fact, the most frequently heard request had to do with the core functionality of the feature itself: the macro should support &lt;em>operations&lt;/em>, that is, &lt;em>predicate logic&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to just have equal match lookups; people wanted support for operations such as &amp;ldquo;is x larger than y&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;does y contain x&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#GTMtips: Fix Problems With GTM Listeners</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/fix-problems-with-gtm-listeners/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2014 17:06:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/fix-problems-with-gtm-listeners/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve written about this before &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-analytics-page-load/">here&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/dont-gtm-listeners-work/">here&lt;/a>, but this issue remains probably the biggest problem users have when implementing Google Tag Manager.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The tip title is actually wrong. You&amp;rsquo;re not fixing &lt;a href="http://tagmanager.google.com">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> listeners. Rather, you&amp;rsquo;re resolving conflicts that &lt;em>other&lt;/em> scripts on your page might introduce.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GTM&amp;rsquo;s event listening is based on something called &lt;strong>event delegation&lt;/strong>.

 &lt;/a>
 

&lt;p>The most important distinction is that auto-event tracking isn&amp;rsquo;t something you control with separate &lt;strong>tags&lt;/strong> anymore. Rather, it&amp;rsquo;s now entirely &lt;em>trigger&lt;/em>-driven, meaning you activate and specify the auto-event tracking of your choice using tag triggers (triggers are what ye olde folk used to call rules).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>eCommerce Tips For Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/ecommerce-tips-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2014 07:10:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/ecommerce-tips-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/3002596?hl=en">setting up eCommerce&lt;/a> in &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/tagmanager">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> (and now the new &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/enhanced-ecommerce">Enhanced ecommerce&lt;/a>) is very difficult for many. I&amp;rsquo;m sure part of the problem is that eCommerce is for many users the moment that GTM forces you to take steps in to the developer&amp;rsquo;s domain, since it&amp;rsquo;s obvious that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to add some code to the web page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This isn&amp;rsquo;t a tutorial on how to do eCommerce in Google Tag Manager. To get started, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to check out the official documentation.

It&amp;rsquo;s basically a piece of code that is passed as an argument to some function, so that when this second function has completed, the callback is executed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For web analytics, callbacks are hugely important, since they allow you to impose a firing order for your asynchronous tags. Asynchronous tags, as you might know, abhor order and precision, so sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to use a callback to have at least an inkling of predictability in your tag jungle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google Tag Manager's Data Model</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-tag-manager-data-model/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2014 10:40:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-tag-manager-data-model/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s time for &lt;a href="http://www.measurecamp.org/">MeasureCamp&lt;/a> again!

&lt;p>This post also picks up where I left in my previous foray into the &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/data-layer/">data layer&lt;/a>.

It lets you poll, using some new properties of the &lt;code>document&lt;/code> object, whether or not the current page is visible to the user. Visibility is hidden if the page is not open in the current browser tab instance, or if the browser window has been minimized.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So, let&amp;rsquo;s go through these points one-by-one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Every tag requires a firing rule to work&lt;/strong> - this is a given.

&lt;p>This is an easy one, and everyone should already be doing this in one way or another. The point is that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t use strings in fields which are often used. Save the string in a macro, so all you have to do is refer to the macro in all your tags. That way, if the string ever changes (for example, when transferring to another property), you don&amp;rsquo;t have to rewrite the field in all your tags.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Persist dataLayer In Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/persist-datalayer-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2014 06:57:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/persist-datalayer-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>(Update 19 November 2018: See &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/persist-datalayer-across-pages/">this article&lt;/a> for a more elegant solution.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you know your &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/javascript-101-gtm-part-1/">JavaScript&lt;/a>, you know that all variables, functions, objects, resources, and data in the document get rewritten with every page load. In other words, every single page refresh builds the page from scratch, and the state of the document before the page refresh is left drifting in the ocean of oblivion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/tagmanager">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s dataLayer is also one such entity. It gets rewritten with every page load, so it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to have a dataLayer variable &lt;em>persist&lt;/em> from one page to the other without using cookies or, as I&amp;rsquo;m going to show in this guide, the &lt;a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp">HTML5 Web Storage API&lt;/a>.

The &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/javascript-101-gtm-part-1/">first part&lt;/a> focused on GTM specific tips and tricks, and I hope that while reading it, you were treated to another grand example of the flexibility of this wonderful tool.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fix GA Site Search With Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/fix-ga-site-search-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2014 06:22:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/fix-ga-site-search-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>Analyzing what people write in your &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1012264?hl=en">site search field&lt;/a> is pretty much one of the smartest things you can do for your website tracking. If certain terms pop up over and over again in internal search reports, it means that your site is not providing the answers people are looking for, meaning you have an excellent opportunity to provide supply for the demand!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>However, not all site search applications are trackable out-of-the-box. In this post, I go over three scenarios, and I provide three solutions for tackling internal site search problems in &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/tagmanager">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>JavaScript 101 For GTM: Part 1</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/javascript-101-gtm-part-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2014 13:25:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/javascript-101-gtm-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Here&amp;rsquo;s the link to &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/javascript-101-gtm-part-2/">part 2 of this JavaScript guide&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The thing about &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/tagmanager">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>, or any JavaScript tag manager for that matter, is that there&amp;rsquo;s JavaScript involved. In fact, the tool itself is just a JavaScript library with some additional bells and whistles (such as a management UI). This means that to make the best of it, some knowledge of JavaScript is warranted, and that&amp;rsquo;s the point of this post.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fun With Google Tag Manager: Part 2</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/fun-google-tag-manager-part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2014 06:52:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/fun-google-tag-manager-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Apologies for leaving you hanging.

&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot going on since the last post. First, my favorite sports team in the world, San Antonio Spurs, &lt;a href="http://nba.si.com/2014/06/15/spurs-win-title-heat-2014-nba-finals/">won their fifth NBA championship&lt;/a> from the defending champs, Miami Heat. Next, my wife and I moved to our new house, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been remodeling ever since. It&amp;rsquo;s been hectic with work and life getting mixed up in a potpourri of saw dust and web analytics, but now it&amp;rsquo;s time to return back to the wonderful world of Google Tag Manager!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fun With Google Tag Manager: Part 1</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/fun-with-google-tag-manager-part-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2014 13:58:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/fun-with-google-tag-manager-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s time to dig into my tip library for some pretty cool things you can do with &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/tagmanager">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> to enhance your site tagging.

The great thing about a POC is that you don&amp;rsquo;t really need to have any viable results or insight-driving technological innovations. The point is to showcase some feature of the platform on which the experiment was conducted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll take a care-free step into the world of POCs again. My goal is to do a simple split test in order to identify which variant of a landing page (or key element thereof) produces the most conversions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Send Mail Upon Google Tag Manager Event</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/send-mail-upon-google-tag-manager-event/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 04:49:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/send-mail-upon-google-tag-manager-event/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to set up a rudimentary email alert system in your &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/tagmanager">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> implementation. Say, for example, you want to receive an email every time an uncaught error occurs on your website. It&amp;rsquo;s not a very good use case, since a large website can spawn hundreds of uncaught exceptions in a short period of time, but let&amp;rsquo;s just pretend for now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you know your JavaScript, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that you can&amp;rsquo;t send mail using client-side code. That&amp;rsquo;s a browser security thing, and I completely understand it. However, a vast majority of websites are created using a CMS which might provide some mail function or hook for you to use. And even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a cooperative web server (or there&amp;rsquo;s no way you can persuade your developers to help), you could use any one of the &lt;a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?apicat=email">online email APIs&lt;/a> that are out there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google Tag Manager: DOM Listener</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-tag-manager-dom-listener/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2014 05:10:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-tag-manager-dom-listener/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through a tutorial on how to create a &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/tagmanager">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> extension. This extension will be a &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/auto-event-tracking-google-tag-manager/">new listener&lt;/a>, whose sole job is to listen for changes in the HTML and CSS markup on the page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason I&amp;rsquo;m teaching you how to create a DOM listener is simple. Ever so often I come across people asking for help, but they are unable to touch on-page code. Usually the problem is magnified with &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/form-tracking-google-tag-manager/">form handlers&lt;/a>, since the developers might have installed some custom jQuery form manager, for instance, which simply refuses to cooperate with GTM&amp;rsquo;s form listeners. That is why you might want to fire a GTM event when a certain message pops up on the screen, for example.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Advanced Form Tracking In Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/form-tracking-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2014 07:30:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/form-tracking-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>There is a new, &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-form-engagement-with-google-tag-manager/">updated version&lt;/a> of this article for the new version of Google Tag Manager.

&lt;p>I really enjoy the ad hoc Q&amp;amp;A sessions my blog posts have inspired. I haven&amp;rsquo;t said this enough, but I am really, REALLY grateful to people who take their time to comment on my posts, even if it&amp;rsquo;s just say a quick &amp;ldquo;Hi!&amp;rdquo;. The main reason I enjoy getting blog comments is because they often turn into blog posts. Seriously, if you&amp;rsquo;re a blogger suffering from writer&amp;rsquo;s block, take a look at your comments. There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em>wealth&lt;/em> of content ideas right there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google Tag Manager: Playing By The Rules</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-tag-manager-playing-rules/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 19:49:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-tag-manager-playing-rules/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>There is a new version of this guide for GTM V2 &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/trigger-guide-google-tag-manager/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Last updated April 2014) I see Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s operational model as an analogy of Montesquieu&amp;rsquo;s three-branched government theory (don&amp;rsquo;t leave just yet, I&amp;rsquo;m getting somewhere with this). We have the &lt;em>legislative&lt;/em> power of &lt;strong>tags&lt;/strong> (what should be done), the &lt;em>judiciary&lt;/em> power of &lt;strong>macros&lt;/strong> (explore the context and circumstance of each tag), and the &lt;em>executive&lt;/em> power of &lt;strong>rules&lt;/strong> (make the tag happen). Not one of these would work without the others, so checks and balances are in place as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some Awesome Google Tag Manager Resources</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/awesome-google-tag-manager-resources/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2014 15:06:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/awesome-google-tag-manager-resources/</guid><description>&lt;p>When push comes to shove, I&amp;rsquo;m a pretty lazy guy. I enjoy nothing more than just to stretch my legs on a couch, pick up my iPad, and read what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the world.

Instead, I head over to my favorite &lt;a href="http://plus.google.com">Google+&lt;/a> communities to see what&amp;rsquo;s new in the blogosphere.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This approach has led me to some pretty amazing individuals, whom I follow like a suckerfish.

&lt;p>You might be vaguely familiar with macros if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever used a computer. Basically, whenever you perform a complicated task with a simple gesture, or reuse complex code with a simple input mechanism, you&amp;rsquo;re using macros. Think keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/tagmanager">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>, this is the essence of macros. You can do away with a lot of complexity by resorting to macros, especially if you ever find that you need the same piece of code or the same operation over and over again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Troubleshoot Google Analytics: 9-Step Program</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/troubleshoot-google-analytics-9-step-program/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2013 16:16:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/troubleshoot-google-analytics-9-step-program/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve had such a blast in the Google+ &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/114481059214254340537">Google Analytics&lt;/a> community.
