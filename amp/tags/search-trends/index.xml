For example, it probably won&amp;rsquo;t astound you to learn that whenever search trends peak for &lt;em>flu symptoms&lt;/em>, there&amp;rsquo;s a similar peak for &lt;em>vaccine&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

 &lt;/a>
 

&lt;p>(See also how at some points &lt;em>vaccine&lt;/em> comes first and only then do &lt;em>flu symptoms&lt;/em> arise. Conspiracy theorists, the ball is in your court!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Probing this particular case further, I looked at the search trends for &lt;em>swine flu&lt;/em> and &lt;em>vaccine&lt;/em>. The former peaks in April 2009 and, to my surprise, &lt;em>vaccine&lt;/em> actually declines over the following two months. However, it skyrockets during the third peak of the &lt;em>swine flu&lt;/em> searches. What does this tell us? I&amp;rsquo;d like to speculate that people have become resilient to rumors, needing factual confirmation before rushing to the vaccine line. However, one thing is sure: This is a clear incentive for pharmacies and health care stations. What better time to promote their goods than the minute search trends for flu activity begin to gain statistical momentum?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
