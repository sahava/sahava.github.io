      <description>Simmer has just released the Technical Marketing Handbook.
It&amp;rsquo;s a free online resource, formatted as a mini-course, designed to walk the reader through the different disciplines and concepts that fall under the banner of &amp;ldquo;technical marketing&amp;rdquo;. And yes, we spend the introductory chapter explaining what that term means to us.
  In total, we wrote 9 chapters, each with 3 topics, for a total of around 77,000 words. For reference, that&amp;rsquo;s about as many words as in the first Harry Potter novel.</description>

      <title>Thoughts On Education</title>

      <description>As my LinkedIn inbox graciously reminded me that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on Simmer for a full three years now, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share a couple of observations about education â€“ particularly in the world of technical digital marketing.
Online courses are an interesting vehicle for education. The medium offers a plethora of different approaches to knowledge transfer, student assessment, and collaboration. It seems like a no-brainer in today&amp;rsquo;s day and age, particularly for someone who wants to build a platform that scales beyond in-person tuition.</description>

      <description>This will likely be the shortest blog article I have ever written, but I have just one short thing to say:
SIMMER IS LIVE!
Simmer is a new online course platform, where we bring technical marketing courses to your computer (or mobile device) screen with a straightforward, task-based approach.
Our first class is aptly Server-side Tagging In Google Tag Manager, and it is open for enrollment right now, all the way until March 14th.</description>
