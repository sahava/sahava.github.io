      <title>#GTMTips: Embed Facebook Messenger Chat With Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/add-facebook-messenger-chat-google-tag-manager/</link>

      <description>A while ago, I published a #GTMTips article, where I showed how you can add HTML elements to the page programmatically using Google Tag Manager. This is relevant because GTM&amp;rsquo;s validators prevent you from adding custom parameters to HTML elements that are injected directly via the Custom HTML tag. To circumvent this validation, you need to create the element programmatically, before appending it to the document.
A while ago, Matteo Gamba asked me a question related to the Facebook Customer Chat Plugin.</description>

      <title>#GTMTips: Check Container ID With eventCallback</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/check-container-id-with-eventcallback/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/check-container-id-with-eventcallback/</guid>
      <description>When you use the dataLayer.push() command on a page with a Google Tag Manager container, you pass information to GTM&amp;rsquo;s internal data model and potentially fire tags (if the push() contained an event key). You can also add the eventCallback key to these pushes. The value of this key should be a function, and this function is then executed once the container finishes processing any tags that might have fired on that dataLayer.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/add-html-elements-page-programmatically/</guid>
      <description>One of the annoying quirks of Google Tag Manager is that it strips out any non-standard HTML attributes from elements you add to Custom HTML tags. I&amp;rsquo;m using &amp;ldquo;non-standard&amp;rdquo; as a qualifier here, because I don&amp;rsquo;t have an exhaustive list of attributes that are ignored. But at least data attributes (e.g. data-id) and attributes with custom names (e.g. aria-labelledby) are either stripped out upon injection, or GTM might actually prevent you from even saving the container if the Custom HTML tag has elements with these attributes.</description>

      <description>This is one of those #GTMTips posts that I was certain I&amp;rsquo;d already written. So it came as a mild surprise when I realized I&amp;rsquo;d never tackled this aspect of Google Tag Manager.
It&amp;rsquo;s a short and sweet tip again. Today we&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to check if a variable is undefined using Google Tag Manager.
Tip 73: Check for undefined variable values   If a variable is undefined, it means that a variable with the given name does not currently have any valid value in memory.</description>

      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/edit-google-analytics-tag-settings/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/edit-google-analytics-tag-settings/</guid>
      <description>When the Google Analytics Settings variable was introduced in May 2017, it resulted in a significant change in the Google Analytics tag user interface in Google Tag Manager. The default UI for editing a tag was stripped down of all GA-specific settings, and the new Google Analytics Settings drop-down was the replacement.
Unfortunately, the bulk of Google Tag Manager articles online (including those on this blog) still refer to the old interface in screenshots and instructions.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/fix-missing-page-view-broken-triggers/</guid>
      <description>Google Tag Manager should be relatively easy to implement. Just paste the container snippet to the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; of the page and you&amp;rsquo;re good to go! However, at some point you&amp;rsquo;ll want to configure the dataLayer structure, too (read more about dataLayer here). There are two ways to do it: the right way and the wrong way.
In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens if you do it the wrong way, how to identify the issue, and how to fix it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back with another customTask tip, but this time I&amp;rsquo;m exploring some new territory. Snowplow just introduced their latest version update, which included (among other things) an adapter for processing Google Analytics payloads. Never heard of Snowplow? It&amp;rsquo;s a collection of open-source libraries designed to let you build your own analytics pipeline, all the way from data collection, through ETL (extract, transform, load), using custom enrichments and JSON schemas, and finally into your own data warehouse, where you can then analyze the data using whatever tools you find preferable.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/simple-custom-event-listeners-gtm/</guid>
      <description>First of all, check out this article for an overview of how custom event listeners work in Google Tag Manager. The reason I&amp;rsquo;m writing this #GTMTips article is that I want to upgrade the solution slightly, and I want to bring it back into the spotlight. Why? Because it&amp;rsquo;s still one of the most effective ways to customize your Google Tag Manager implementation.
A custom event listener is a handler you write with JavaScript.</description>

      <title>#GTMTips: Opt-out Of Google Analytics Tracking</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/opt-out-of-google-analytics-tracking/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/opt-out-of-google-analytics-tracking/</guid>
      <description>A while ago I posted a #GTMTips post where I detailed the steps you can take to opt-out of all Google Analytics tracking and the DoubleClick redirects that often follow. It was a fun exercise, but because it relies on preventing requests on a tag-by-tag basis (using the ubiquituous customTask), it can be a chore to handle in large containers.
In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll continue with the theme of opting out from Google Analytics tracking by leveraging a solution provided by the tool itself.</description>

      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/auto-link-domains-with-regex/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/auto-link-domains-with-regex/</guid>
      <description>Google Tag Manager makes it fairly easy to do cross-domain tracking. Basically, you list the hostnames you want to automatically decorate with linker parameters in the Auto-Link Domains field of your Page View tag, and that takes care of decorating the URLs with the necessary parameter. It&amp;rsquo;s dead easy, even if there are a bunch of traps you need to watch out for (see my post on troubleshooting cross-domain tracking issues).</description>

      <description>One of the challenges in working with Google Tag Manager (or any JavaScript-based platform for that matter) is what to do with race conditions. A race condition emerges when you have two resources competing for execution in the browser, and there is a degree of unpredictability to which &amp;ldquo;wins&amp;rdquo; the race.
A prime example is working with jQuery. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the most popular JavaScript libraries out there, and websites utilize it for a multitude of things, many useful for Google Tag Manager, too.</description>

      <description>With GDPR looming around the corner, it&amp;rsquo;s time to explore the options you have at your disposal for respecting the new, stricter regulations for tracking users and for collecting data about their visits to your website.
In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the wonderful customTask (again), to see how you can programmatically prevent the request to Google Analytics or the redirect to DoubleClick from ever taking place, in case certain conditions are met.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/remove-pii-google-analytics-hits/</guid>
      <description>Sending personally identifiable information (PII) to Google Analytics is one of the things you should really avoid doing. For one, it&amp;rsquo;s against the terms of service of the platform, but also you will most likely be in violation of national, federal, or EU legislation drafted to protect the privacy of individuals online.
In this #GTMTips post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you a way to make sure that any tags you configure this solution with will not contain strings that might be construed as PII.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/pagination-and-quick-search/</guid>
      <description>If you open the Google Tag Manager user interface and browser your tags, triggers, and variables, you might notice that the UI now has two new features:
 Pagination, where only 50 results are shown per page
 A quick search / filter bar at the top of each list, which lets you narrow the list down to results that match your query
  Pagination might be a nuisance in large containers, but it was implemented to improve performance.</description>

      <description>Facebook&amp;rsquo;s pixel has an attribute named content_ids (required for Dynamic Ads), which requires an Array of content IDs as its value. It&amp;rsquo;s very possible you&amp;rsquo;re running this pixel on a site which already has Enhanced Ecommerce for Universal Analytics implemented, and now you want to use the same Enhanced Ecommerce data that your developers have already made available in this Facebook pixel.
Or perhaps you want to concatenate a list of strings, such as article tags ([&#39;culture&#39;, &#39;politics&#39;]), and send it as a comma-separated string to Google Analytics (&#39;culture,politics&#39;).</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/send-google-analytics-tag-multiple-properties/</guid>
      <description>Here we are again, revisiting an old theme. When using Google Tag Manager, we often want to send the contents of the same tag to multiple Universal Analytics properties. With on-page GA, this used to be quite simple, as all you had to do was create a new tracker and then just remember to run the ga(&#39;trackerName.send&#39;...) commands to all the trackers (or you could use my duplicator plugin). With GTM, your options are more limited, since Google Tag Manager abstracts the tracker object, giving you far fewer tools to work with.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/use-customtask-access-tracker-values-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>One of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve recommended from the get-go is to always send the Client ID to Google Analytics with your users&amp;rsquo; hits. This is very useful for adding a level of granularity to your tracking. At first, I recommended using an Event tag to do this. Then I modified my approach a little so that you could send it with your initial Page View (thus not inflating your hit counts).</description>

      <description>In this #GTMTips article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at user permissions and access control levels that Google Tag Manager lets you set today. Doing access control right from a user interface AND user experience perspective is really difficult, and GTM is no exception. Nevertheless, there are several levels of user control that you can modify from account and container settings, and it&amp;rsquo;s useful to familiarize with these so that managing a big, sprawling account hierarchy would be just a bit easier.</description>

      <description>To be fair, this tip isn&amp;rsquo;t just for Google Tag Manager but for regular old on-page Google Analytics as well. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those little things that&amp;rsquo;s corroding your data quality without you ever realizing it. Namely, this tip is about how to handle cross-domain tracking in situations where you are sending data to multiple Google Analytics properties on the same page.
It&amp;rsquo;s a very typical scenario - you have a &amp;ldquo;local&amp;rdquo; property, which tracks only the traffic of the current site, and then a &amp;ldquo;rollup&amp;rdquo; property, where you send data from all your organization&amp;rsquo;s websites.</description>

      <description>The beauty of #GTMTips, at least how I&amp;rsquo;ve envisioned them, is that they can be really simple or crazy complex. The important thing is that the idea is conveyed clearly enough. That&amp;rsquo;s why so many of these tips have originated from discussions in our Google Tag Manager Google+ community, the Product Forums, and in private email correspondence with people asking for help. Today&amp;rsquo;s tip, for example, originated from a back-and-forth with Süleyman Okan, so thank you for the inspiration!</description>

This time, we&amp;rsquo;re going over some useful JavaScript tips and tricks that you can use to make your Google Tag Manager deployment even more efficient. I&amp;rsquo;ve written a lot about JavaScript in this blog, and I intend to keep on doing so in the future.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/10-useful-css-selectors/</guid>
      <description>Without a doubt, the possibility to leverage CSS selectors in Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s trigger conditions is one of the most useful features of the platform. It gives you an amazing amount of flexibility, especially when combined with GTM&amp;rsquo;s click and form triggers.
Essentially, CSS selectors let you test an HTML Element against a selector string. This check verifies that the element matches the given selector. In practice, this would mean that when you use the click or form trigger, you can check if the Click Element or Form Element built-in variables match a specific selector, allowing you to confirm that the action happened on the correct element.</description>

      <description>A while ago, the Google Tag Manager team published one of my favorite feature releases in the history of GTM: Workspaces. I was so thrilled by this release that I went ahead and published a guide on how to implement and leverage this new feature.
Workspaces is a very comprehensive feature in Google Tag Manager. This is because it changed the entire underlying data model. We no longer work directly with a single container draft.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/fix-rogue-referral-problem-single-page-sites/</guid>
      <description>Single-page sites (or single-page apps) typically have just one page load. When navigating the site, subsequent content is either uncovered from the DOM, where it&amp;rsquo;s been in a hidden state, or loaded from the server using HTTP requests that do not invoke a new page refresh. This behavior, however, has some implications for Google Analytics tracking, especially when configured via Google Tag Manager.
The crux of the problem is this: When you create a Google Analytics tracker, the URL of the page (without a possible #hash) from when the tracker was created is sent as the value of the Document Location field with every hit that uses this tracker.</description>

This tip is so useful and simple; it encapsulates everything that I had in mind when starting this series. The tip is about restricting scope of Custom HTML Tags. This is an important concept, because it&amp;rsquo;s possible that you&amp;rsquo;re stuffing your page&amp;rsquo;s global JavaScript namespace with all sorts of junk, and thus inadvertently causing conflicts.</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager can be quite the hierarchical mess. You have accounts which comprise containers. Containers are split into container versions, and you use workspaces to create new versions. Phew! Trying to keep tabs on all the activity within these layers can be quite the chore.
In this #GTMTips article, I&amp;rsquo;ll do a quick walkthrough of (almost) all the places where you can review changes made in your Google Tag Manager account and container.</description>

      <description>There are times when I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed with Google&amp;rsquo;s developer documentation, especially for Google Tag Manager. Most of the time they get it right, and I&amp;rsquo;d say around 80% of questions being thrown around the forums can be answered just by reading through the documentation. But there are some cases where the documentation is misleading or even downright dangerous. One of these cases is Enhanced Ecommerce.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be a thorough critique of said documentation, but the tip in this post has to do with one of the examples that the documentation gives for measuring Product Clicks.</description>

      <description>Have you created a Chrome Extension, and now you&amp;rsquo;re dying to find out how users are interacting with it? Perhaps you want to see what features are (not) being utilized, or perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re just interested in knowing if people are actually using it.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to configure Google Tag Manager, so that it works in the restricted sandbox of the Chrome Extension. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to make some tweaks, but it&amp;rsquo;s still perfectly doable.</description>

Dan Wilkerson is an analytics developer at LunaMetrics, a company I hold in high esteem. Dan is one of the smartest technical analytics experts out there, and a large bulk of the awesome scripts and hacks that LunaMetrics produces (almost on a daily basis) have been orchestrated by him. So I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased to give the floor to Dan, so that he can tell you all about using the pesky document.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/timer-trigger/</guid>
      <description>Google Tag Manager has a Trigger type which fires after a certain duration of time has passed on the web page: the Timer Trigger. The most common uses for the Timer Trigger seem to be either to send an event to Google Analytics after X seconds of dwell time (to kill the Bounce), or to defer a Tag from firing until some asynchronous request has completed with certainty.
In the previous version of Google Tag Manager, the Timer was a separate listener Tag, which meant that you could start a timer based on a user interaction such as a click.</description>

      <description>Back back to the friggin&amp;rsquo; basics. Almost two years ago, I wrote a two-parter on how to have fun with Google Tag Manager: Part 1, and Part 2. The first part had a nice exercise for tracking JavaScript Errors as Google Analytics Events, using the recently published &amp;ldquo;JavaScript Error Listener&amp;rdquo; Tag.
Well, that was in GTM V1. Now we&amp;rsquo;ve been smoothly sailing with the wonderful new interface for well over a year, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to update some of these nifty tricks.</description>

      <description>Hello friends! Today I want to direct your attention to a dangerous setting found within the bowels of the Universal Analytics Tag template in Google Tag Manager. In fact, GTM itself highly discourages you from meddling with it:
  I actually agree with this warning. It should be highly discouraged, as modifying the tracker name introduces a potential hazard to your tracking plan, unless you know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s Data Layer is something I&amp;rsquo;ve touched upon in pretty much all of my articles. It&amp;rsquo;s such an integral part of what makes a tag management solution great and applicable to a host of business scenarios. I&amp;rsquo;ve also talked at length about the internal data model of Google Tag Manager, and this #GTMTips post is very much related to this rather murky concept.
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll go over the Data Layer Variable Version selection, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain just what this selector does.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/gtmtips-track-launch-campaigns-in-gtm-for-ios/</guid>
      <description>In Google Analytics for iOS, there are two types of campaign measurement. There&amp;rsquo;s install campaign measurement, which lets you track the channels which brought your visitors to the App Store, where they proceeded to download your app. There&amp;rsquo;s also launch campaign tracking, which lets you attribute app launches to specific campaigns.
In this tip post, we&amp;rsquo;ll tackle the latter. We&amp;rsquo;ll leverage a feature of the Google Analytics iOS SDK to build the parameters, and then push them to dataLayer so that they can be used in the Tag.</description>

      <description>One of the less-known features of Google Tag Manager, a hidden gem if you will, is the URL Source setting in the URL Variable type. It lets you parse any URL String for its components.
Tip 38: Parse URL strings with the URL Source setting   The setting itself is easy to find. Just edit an existing URL Variable, or create a new one. Then, scroll down to the More Settings divider, expand it, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see the URL Source drop-down list.</description>

      <description>For some reason, you might run into a situation where you need to add multiple Google Tag Manager containers on the same page. Usually this is because of poor governance or an inflexible organization. My recommendation is to fix things in your projects first, and only resort to multiple containers if you can&amp;rsquo;t seem to resolve your governance issues using your vocal cords (or your fists).
Officially, Google Tag Manager introduced support for adding multiple containers earlier in 2015.</description>

      <description>(UPDATE 28 Sep 2016: The official recommendation has finally caught up with the times. Now the correct placement for the JavaScript methods of the container snippet is, indeed, in &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;.)
I want to address something I&amp;rsquo;ve been confused about from the very first day since I started using Google Tag Manager. Why on earth would an asynchronously loading JavaScript library be recommended to place in the beginning of &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;, when the logical place to start loading dependencies is as early as possible in the document load process?</description>

      <description>A while ago I wrote a blog post about how to install Google Tag Manager for iOS using the Swift programming language (you can read the article here). I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of work with Swift lately, and I&amp;rsquo;m more and more convinced that GTM is actually a very powerful utility for running in your iOS app instead of the Google Analytics SDK.
Why? Because it abstracts a lot of the nitty-gritty you&amp;rsquo;d otherwise need to explicitly manage in your GA installation.</description>

      <description>You might have noticed that the Referral Exclusion List in Google Analytics is difficult to maintain. You can&amp;rsquo;t copy a list from one property to another, the list is a wildcard match for domain names (so all subdomains are automatically excluded), and it&amp;rsquo;s just about the clunkiest user interface we&amp;rsquo;ve seen since ERP tools from the 1990s. A while ago, I wrote of a solution which lets you manage referral exclusions using Google Tag Manager, and it&amp;rsquo;s still a neat trick, as it&amp;rsquo;s way more flexible than said clunky UI.</description>

      <description>Every now and then we want to create a bridge between the stateful machines we send data to (e.g. Google Analytics), and the stateless environment where we collect the data itself (e.g. Google Tag Manager). This is not easy. There is no synergy between Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager which would let the latter understand anything about things like sessions or landing pages or Bounce Rates.
One thing we can reliably measure, however, is whether or not the visitor is a New User in Google Analytics.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately, iFrames still exist. They are used to embed content from one page into another. Frames are horrible, nasty things, very often riddled with cross-domain problems, performance issues, responsive design obstructions and other crap from the nether pits of hell. Regardless, if you&amp;rsquo;re stuck with an iFrame which also collects data to your Google Analytics property, for example, you probably want to prevent at least the first Page View from firing, since otherwise you&amp;rsquo;ll be double-counting Page Views: once on the main page and once in the iFrame.</description>

      <description>With the advent of Enhanced Ecommerce for Universal Analytics, a new scope was introduced for Custom Dimensions and Metrics. Product scope can be used to send information about each product that is sent through Enhanced Ecommerce, but it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly the most logical or intuitive thing to wrap your head around.
In this #GTMTips post, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at how to implement Product-Scoped Custom definitions via Google Tag Manager, and I&amp;rsquo;ll quickly explain how they work in relation to queries and reports you might want to build on top of them.</description>

      <description>To prevent a Tag from firing in Google Tag Manager, you can:
 Delete the Tag
 Remove all Triggers from the Tag
 Add an Exception Trigger to the Tag
  The third option is usually the best if the blocking is just temporary. Exceptions are what used to be called blocking rules in the first version of GTM. To add them is easy enough. In the Fire On step of Tag creation, you can click Create Exceptions, and choose the Trigger that will block this Tag from firing.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/access-array-members-in-the-data-layer/</guid>
      <description>In JavaScript, if you want to access an Array member, you use square bracket notation to retrieve the value stored at a specific index. Indices are numbered in order, with the first index always being at location zero (0). This means that to get the first value stored in Array simo, you&amp;rsquo;d use something like:
var firstValue = simo[0]; In Google Tag Manager, you can push Arrays into the Data Layer.</description>

      <description>Maintaining the list of Referral Exclusions in Google Analytics admin is a pain. Especially if you have a webstore, the number of referral sources you need to exclude to avoid sessions being split can grow really fast. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s not like the list is has the most intuitive UI. Instead of a handy text area where you could just copy-paste stuff, you&amp;rsquo;re left with a horrible line-by-line list, and there&amp;rsquo;s no way of copying lists across properties or anything useful like that.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a tip that&amp;rsquo;s especially important to anyone working with a single-page application. Google Tag Manager persists items in its data model until you either manually delete the variable and/or its value from the data model, or until the user browses away from the page. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing as annoying as the example in the image below, where a value that was set for an earlier Tag is resent with a new Tag, even though the purpose was to leave it out.</description>

      <description>PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is something we need to actively combat against when using Google Analytics, as the platform explicitly forbids sending PII to Google Analytics properties in any size, form, or shape.
One of the most common ways of accidentally passing PII to a property is via query parameters. Many email platforms out there, for example, see no problem in including the user&amp;rsquo;s email address in the query string, especially when the user follows a link in a newsletter.</description>

Blogger is a free blogging service by Google. Like WordPress, they allow you to run hosted blogs on the blogger.com domain, and they also allow you to modify the HTML source.

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a very quick tip this time, but one that&amp;rsquo;s caused a lot of headache for many Google Tag Manager users.
Tip 21: Use the All Pages Trigger correctly   Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, All Pages isn&amp;rsquo;t really an intuitive Trigger name. Many seem to interpret it as: enable the Tag to fire on all pages, but use the other Trigger (e.g. Link Click) to actually fire it.
As it turns out, the All Pages Trigger will fire the Tag on all pages.</description>

      <description>On March 30th, right on (the latest) schedule, the Migration Assistant tool was published for Google Tag Manager V2. This tool lets you opt-in to account migration for your legacy Google Tag Manager Accounts. Migration means simply that the accounts will be converted to V2 accounts, and you will have access to all the new features the upgrade provides.
In this #GTMtips post, we&amp;rsquo;ll go over the migration steps (it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple), and I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with a couple of tips on how to get started with the new features.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/debugging-tag-execution-properly/</guid>
      <description>One of the unfortunate misunderstandings regarding the wonderful Google Tag Manager Preview mode is what it actually means when GTM reports &amp;ldquo;Tags Fired On This Event&amp;rdquo;. For many, this seems to indicate that whatever code the Tag was meant to execute also completed successfully. However, this is not the case.
Tip 19: Debugging Tag execution vs. actual requests   Let&amp;rsquo;s get the distinction straight right away:
Google Tag Manager debug panel tells you when a Trigger has been invoked by certain conditions, and the Tag which uses this Trigger has its JavaScript injected into the Document Object Model.</description>

      <description>(Updated 15 July 2015: Added a huge simplification. Jump straight to the update at the end.)
URL fragments are strings of characters that follow a hash mark (#) in the URL. Typically, they are used for anchor links, where following a link keeps you on the same page but jumps the browser to some anchored position. They&amp;rsquo;re also the tool of choice for single-page apps, where content is served dynamically without page reloads.</description>

      <description>In Google Tag Manager, every single Tag requires a Trigger to fire. Every single Trigger requires an Event condition to activate. Sometimes, these Event conditions are obfuscated under template semantics, but you can also create a Custom Event Trigger, where you specify the value of the &amp;lsquo;event&amp;rsquo; key in dataLayer that fires your tag. You can read more about the relationship between GTM events and Tags in these two posts:</description>

      <description>Due to a recent change in the UI (see entry for February 12, 2015 in the release notes), the large and ever-expanding group of fields you could set for your Universal Analytics tags has been mostly removed. Instead, the often obscure Fields to Set selection has been promoted to the top of More Settings, and you control most of the Universal Analytics fields through this selector.
In this #GTMtips, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick look at what&amp;rsquo;s changed, how it&amp;rsquo;s changed, and how to work with this new, slimmed-down tag template.</description>

Also, &amp;ldquo;tracking file downloads&amp;rdquo; means sending Events to Google Analytics, so this is a GA for GTM guide as well.
Tip 15: Set up file download tracking in GTM   Since we&amp;rsquo;re using Google Analytics as the tracking platform, we&amp;rsquo;ll need the following ingredients to make this setup work:</description>

Tracking outbound links is important for many. Identifying the exit paths is almost as important as tracking entrances. In this simple #GTMtips post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to track outbound links with a simple Trigger + Auto-Event Variable combination in the new Google Tag Manager interface.

      <description>With Google Tag Manager, there are a million different ways to make your tagging setup leaner and more flexible. The reason this should be a priority is because the UI isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect. The more tags you have, the more difficult it becomes to manage your assets.
In this #GTMtips post, I show you one of my favorite ways to put your container on a diet.
Tip 13: How to create a Generic Event Tag   I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of containers that suffer from the same problem.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of the Konami Code. It&amp;rsquo;s a cheat code in many Konami games, where the cheat is executed with a sequence of key presses on the keyboard. Since then, it&amp;rsquo;s become one of the staples of video game folk lore, and many websites, games, and applications have their own easter eggs activated with the Konami code.
The sequence of keys is:
up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A</description>

      <description>In this tip, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at how to leverage a custom first-party cookie to prevent repeat hits of any kind. This is most useful for transactions, since a common problem with Google Analytics (traditional) eCommerce tracking is that a transaction hit is sent again upon subsequent entries to the receipt page, for example using the Back button of the browser. In some cases, and this is not a good practice, a receipt e-mail is sent to the user with a link back to the receipt page, where the transaction is sent over and over again upon entry.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written about this before here and here, but this issue remains probably the biggest problem users have when implementing Google Tag Manager.
Tip 10: Resolve conflicts with GTM&amp;rsquo;s listeners   The tip title is actually wrong. You&amp;rsquo;re not fixing Google Tag Manager listeners. Rather, you&amp;rsquo;re resolving conflicts that other scripts on your page might introduce.
GTM&amp;rsquo;s event listening is based on something called event delegation. Event delegation makes use of the document object model (DOM) and its tree-like hierarchy.</description>

You can find the new version at http://tagmanager.google.com/, and there&amp;rsquo;s already a bunch of good articles about the new UI out there. I want to point out two: &amp;ldquo;Setting up GA via GTM&amp;rsquo;s new UX&amp;rdquo; by Krista Seiden, and &amp;ldquo;Google Tag Manager Refresh – 6 Things You Need to Know&amp;rdquo; by Jonathan Weber from Lunametrics.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/auto-event-tracking-gtm-2-0/</guid>
      <description>In the new version of Google Tag Manager, auto-event tracking has received a considerable usability upgrade. It might seem quirky at first, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re used to the old auto-event tracking method, but the logic behind the new setup is brilliant.
  The most important distinction is that auto-event tracking isn&amp;rsquo;t something you control with separate tags anymore. Rather, it&amp;rsquo;s now entirely trigger-driven, meaning you activate and specify the auto-event tracking of your choice using tag triggers (triggers are what ye olde folk used to call rules).</description>

      <description>The User ID is definitely one of the coolest things about Universal Analytics, if used correctly. It might reveal some surprising insights about your visitors, since now you&amp;rsquo;re not restricted to analysing visitors as just browser or device instances as before, but rather you can build your stories around all the touch points the user might have had on their journey to and through your web properties.
With this simple tip, you can extend User ID tracking to return users without them needing to authenticate.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/datalayer-declaration-vs-push/</guid>
      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a tip on how to avoid a horrible, horrible mistake with Google Tag Manager.
Tip 7: Always use .push() with dataLayer   When you assign a value to a variable using the equals ( = ) sign, you are actually reallocating the variable to a new value, and the garbage collection system of the runtime environment sweeps the previous value to bit heaven.
Let&amp;rsquo;s put it simply: if you redefine dataLayer after the GTM container snippet, you will break GTM&amp;rsquo;s proprietary functions.</description>

      <description>This time we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at two different, JavaScript-y features of Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager. Callback as a concept should be familiar to anyone who&amp;rsquo;s ever used a programming language. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a piece of code that is passed as an argument to some function, so that when this second function has completed, the callback is executed.
For web analytics, callbacks are hugely important, since they allow you to impose a firing order for your asynchronous tags.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/chain-macros-lookup-tables/</guid>
      <description>One of the cool things about using a tag management solution is that you can leverage variables like never before. In Google Tag Manager, these variables are referred to as macros, and you can identify a macro with the syntax of {{macro name}}. In this tip I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you can actually call macros from other macros, using a Lookup Table as an example.
Tip 5: Chain Macros In Lookup Tables (And Other Macros)   It&amp;rsquo;s not just Lookup Tables, either.</description>

      <description>This might not sound like a tip to you. You might think, &amp;ldquo;Dimensions won&amp;rsquo;t get sent? Sounds like a bug!&amp;rdquo;. You&amp;rsquo;re wrong. This is one of the awesome features of the GA API, and it&amp;rsquo;s key to making your tag setups leaner when sending data to Google Analytics.
Tip 4: Undefined dimensions are left out of GA hits   Note that &amp;lsquo;undefined&amp;rsquo; here means the special value undefined in JavaScript.</description>

      <description>Rules are the cornerstone of Google Tag Manager. As with any critical element in a system, they are easy to get wrong. This tip is just a refresher on how GTM firing and blocking rules work.
Tip 3: Google Tag Manager rules in a nutshell   So, let&amp;rsquo;s go through these points one-by-one.
Every tag requires a firing rule to work - this is a given. Without a firing rule, your tag will not be written in the document object, and it will never be executed.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple way to check what was the source of the visitor&amp;rsquo;s arrival to the current page. It&amp;rsquo;s done by utilizing the {{referrer}} macro, which comes out-of-the-box in any GTM setup.
Tip 2: Use {{referrer}} to see where the visitor came from   You might want to also explore the Component Types and create new macros for {{referrer path}} and {{referrer host name}} for example:
  By default, you see, the {{referrer}} macro returns the entire URL of the previous page.</description>
