      <description>The Scroll Depth trigger in Google Tag Manager has a lot going for it.

      <description>Scroll depth tracking in web analytics is one of those things you simply must do, especially if you have a content-heavy site.

If you&amp;rsquo;ve already been tracking scroll depth in Google Tag Manager, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably been using either Rob Flaherty&amp;rsquo;s brilliant Scroll Depth jQuery plugin, or LunaMetrics&amp;rsquo; equally ingenious Scroll Tracking recipe.</description>
