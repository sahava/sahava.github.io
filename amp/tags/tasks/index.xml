&lt;p>If you have been reading my blog articles over the past year, you might have noticed a disturbing trend. I&amp;rsquo;ve published &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/tags/customtask/">9 articles on &lt;code>customTask&lt;/code>&lt;/a> since the API was released. It might not sound like much, but I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a single feature in &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> that has so completely convinced me of its usefulness in such a short time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>customTask&lt;/code> API is a feature of the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/tasks">Universal Analytics library&lt;/a> (used by Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s tags, too). It lets you &lt;code>get&lt;/code> and &lt;code>set&lt;/code> values from and to the (Measurement Protocol) hit as it&amp;rsquo;s being generated. This is really useful for a couple of reasons, which I&amp;rsquo;ve covered in the previous articles, but I&amp;rsquo;ll go over them briefly in the beginning of this guide, too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#GTMTips: Send Google Analytics Tag To Multiple Properties</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/send-google-analytics-tag-multiple-properties/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2017 07:54:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/send-google-analytics-tag-multiple-properties/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here we are again, revisiting an old theme. When using &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>, we often want to send the contents of the same tag to multiple &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com">Universal Analytics&lt;/a> properties. With on-page GA, this used to be quite simple, as all you had to do was create a new tracker and then just remember to run the &lt;code>ga('trackerName.send'...)&lt;/code> commands to all the trackers (or you could use my &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/simple-tracker-duplication-universal-analytics/">duplicator&lt;/a> plugin). With GTM, your options are more limited, since Google Tag Manager abstracts the tracker object, giving you far fewer tools to work with.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#GTMTips: Use customTask To Access Tracker Values In Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/use-customtask-access-tracker-values-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2017 08:27:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/use-customtask-access-tracker-values-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve recommended from the get-go is to &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/improve-data-collection-with-four-custom-dimensions/">always send the Client ID&lt;/a> to &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics&lt;/a> with your users&amp;rsquo; hits. This is very useful for adding a level of granularity to your tracking. At first, I recommended using an Event tag to do this. Then I modified my approach a little so that you could send it with your initial &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/access-the-tracker-object-in-your-page-view-tag/">Page View&lt;/a> (thus not inflating your hit counts).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, Universal Analytics recently released a new &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/tasks">task API&lt;/a>, &lt;code>customTask&lt;/code>, which lets you access the model object mid-tag, thus letting you modify the payload that is dispatched to Google Analytics. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how this works by using the classic example of sending the Client ID to Google Analytics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Simple Tracker Duplication For Universal Analytics</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/simple-tracker-duplication-universal-analytics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2016 10:49:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/simple-tracker-duplication-universal-analytics/</guid><description>&lt;p>First of all, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry about the title. I should really stop throwing the word &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; around, since people always tell me that the stuff I claim to be easy and straightforward is rarely so. But since this is my blog, I reserve the right to use whatever stupid and misleading terminology I want. I maintain that what follows IS quite simple, especially when considering the amount of complexity it reduces in your &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Universal Analytics&lt;/a> setup.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
