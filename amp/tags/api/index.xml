      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a big feature update to my GTM Tools, a free tool for managing your Google Tag Manager containers, tags, triggers, variables, and now: workspaces.
  In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll quickly go over the main features of Workspace mode. Be sure to check out the updated Release Notes &amp;amp; User Guide.
Introduction First of all, you can access Workspace mode through the container selection screen, or via the container page:</description>

      <title>New Tools Released</title>

      <description>Over the past few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding like crazy. The three biggest outcomes of this frenzy have been this new blog design (switched finally away from WordPress and took the plunge back into the world static sites using Hugo), a new Google Sheets add-on for managing Google Tag Manager containers and assets, and a Slack integration in GTM Tools. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll quickly introduce the last two, as I&amp;rsquo;m writing a separate article about the site redesign.</description>

      <title>GTM Tools: Release Notes And User Guide</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/gtm-tools-release-notes-and-user-guide/</link>

      <description>With the release of the latest Google Tag Manager API version, it&amp;rsquo;s time to release the new version of GTM Tools. Most of the changes have been done under the hood, with the entire codebase refactored for improved stability.
I released the first toolset in October 2014, and quickly released an updated UI a few months later. Aside from a few bug fixes and stability improvements, the tools have remained largely unchanged since then.</description>

      <title>Google Tag Manager API V2 Released</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-tag-manager-api-v2-released/</link>

      <description>Google Tag Manager has a very nifty programmatic API that lets you do almost anything that&amp;rsquo;s also possible within the GTM UI. I&amp;rsquo;ve used the API a lot, most notably for my GTM Tools, which might be getting a new release soon, too!
The API was recently updated to its second release version (V2), and in this article I want to go over the additions, removals, and changes that the new version introduced.</description>

      <title>Mixcloud Player Tracking In Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/mixcloud-player-integration-google-tag-manager/</link>

      <description>A couple of years ago I wrote an article on tracking interactions with the SoundCloud widget via Google Tag Manager. When a platform provides a JavaScript embed API, it&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly easy to track interactions with the player. You&amp;rsquo;ve seen this with YouTube, with SoundCloud, with JWPlayer, and now you&amp;rsquo;ll see how to do this with the Mixcloud player.
  If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Mixcloud is, well it&amp;rsquo;s a hugely popular streaming service for DJs, podcasts, radio shows, and other published radio media.</description>

      <title>Spam Filter Insertion Tool</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/spam-filter-insertion-tool/</guid>
      <description>Last weekend, I wrote a very simple web app that automatically creates a number of referral spam filters to tackle the problem that seems to have everybody all riled up.
  For a nice recap of the situation, take a look at this post by Jeff Sauer, or this article by Mike Sullivan.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t an opinion piece, even though I&amp;rsquo;ve got a great number of opinions about this issue.</description>

      <title>Send Weather Data To Google Analytics In GTM V2</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/send-weather-data-to-google-analytics-in-gtm-v2/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/send-weather-data-to-google-analytics-in-gtm-v2/</guid>
      <description>In 2013, I wrote a guide for Universal Analytics and Google Tag Manager on how to poll for weather conditions, and send this information to Google Analytics as a custom dimension of the session. The guide was intended as a technical introduction to Google Tag Manager, and I think it succeeded in that.
However, GTM has changed a lot over the last 1.5 years, and I&amp;rsquo;ve made some improvements to the method along the way.</description>

      <title>Introducing GTM Tools</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written a completely revamped version of this toolset for Google Tag Manager V2.
Well, I just yesterday published the first of my GTM API tools (the Container Visualizer), and I vowed that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t release the other tools for a number of reasons.
The reasons were good, in my opinion (especially the part about the tools being ugly as crap), but on the other hand I don&amp;rsquo;t want to keep anyone away from the amazing potential of the new API.</description>

      <title>Container Visualizer for Google Tag Manager</title>

      <description>[UPDATE:] Quite a lot of people had trouble accessing the tool after I published this post. This should now be fixed.
So, AWESOME stuff. The new Google Tag Manager UI and API have just rolled out, and I can finally start revealing the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on :)
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into the new UI in this post. I just want to give a huge thanks to the GTM team for working on the UX with such dedication.</description>

      <title>Persist dataLayer In Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/persist-datalayer-google-tag-manager/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/persist-datalayer-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>If you know your JavaScript, you know that all variables, functions, objects, resources, and data in the document get rewritten with every page load. In other words, every single page refresh builds the page from scratch, and the state of the document before the page refresh is left drifting in the ocean of oblivion.
Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s dataLayer is also one such entity. It gets rewritten with every page load, so it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to have a dataLayer variable persist from one page to the other without using cookies or, as I&amp;rsquo;m going to show in this guide, the HTML5 Web Storage API.</description>

      <title>Block Internal Traffic With Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/block-internal-traffic-gtm/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/block-internal-traffic-gtm/</guid>
      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably come across a number of guides or posts talking about why it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to block so-called internal traffic from your web analytics reports. The reasons are pretty solid: internal traffic does not emulate normal visitor behavior, it rarely contributes to conversions (skewing up your conversion rate), it inflates page views, and it wreaks havoc on your granular, page-by-page data.
Internal traffic is vaguely described as &amp;ldquo;your employees&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;people really close to your brand&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;your marketing department&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;your web editors&amp;rdquo;, and so on.</description>

      <title>Universal Analytics: Weather As A Custom Dimension</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/web-development/universal-analytics-weather-custom-dimension/</link>

      <description>There is a new version of this post for GTM V2 here.
[Last updated June 2014] I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen in love with Universal Analytics and Google Tag Manager. Together they form an incredibly powerful tool for marketing professionals. In most cases, I no longer need to post recommendations to my client for yet another page template revision, since with the tag manager in place, I can just add custom code via the admin panel.</description>
