      <description>A while ago, I published an article on how to build an Android application, and bundle it with Firebase. The purpose of that article, and the one you are reading now, is to slowly introduce the world of mobile app development and Firebase, given the latter is getting more and more traction as Google&amp;rsquo;s go-to analytics platform.
After finishing work on the Android guide, I immediately started working on its counterpart for iOS, and that&amp;rsquo;s the one you&amp;rsquo;re reading now.</description>

      <description>With the release of Google Analytics: App + Web, Firebase is suddenly all the rage. The new App + Web property can combine data from your website and mobile apps, as long as the latter uses Google Analytics for Firebase, formerly known as Firebase Analytics.
In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the steps of creating an extremely simple Android application, and we&amp;rsquo;ll then create a Firebase project, and for good measure add Google Tag Manager to the mix.</description>

      <description>Google recently released a new version of Google Analytics called App + Web. Clumsy name aside, this really is for all intents and purposes Google Analytics V2 or Firebase Analytics for the Web. We&amp;rsquo;re not talking about a charming way to do roll-up reporting between Google Analytics for Firebase and Universal Analytics, nor are we talking about an enhancement to Universal Analytics.
  No, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about a new measurement model for web traffic, which has the convenience of being compatible with Google Analytics for Firebase, which you might already have running in your apps.</description>
