      <description>Here&#39;s an interesting and hacky use case for you. It&#39;s all about uncovering bounce metrics for visits which originate from organic Google search results. In particular, the metric we&#39;re interested in is how long user dwelled on the landing page after arriving from organic Google search AND returned to the search engine results page (SERP) using the browser&#39;s back button.
  The inspiration for this post came from an audience question at the Best Internet Conference in Lithuania, which I recently attended as a speaker.</description>
