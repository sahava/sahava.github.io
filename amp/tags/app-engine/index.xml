&lt;p>The main benefits of doing this are that you get to &lt;strong>choose the region where App Engine is deployed&lt;/strong> and that you can use &lt;strong>existing project resources&lt;/strong> instead of having a new project automatically created for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, to run the script without errors, there are a number of things you need to enable first. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the required permissions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#GTMTips: Map Multiple Domains To A Server-side Tagging Endpoint</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/map-multiple-domains-server-side-tagging-endpoint/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 14:38:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/map-multiple-domains-server-side-tagging-endpoint/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the biggest perks of working with &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/server-side-tagging-google-tag-manager/">server-side tagging&lt;/a> is that you can establish a &lt;strong>first-party context&lt;/strong> between the site sending the data and the server-side tagging endpoint itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This leads to &lt;em>many&lt;/em> benefits, including improved control of the &lt;strong>data streams&lt;/strong>, the possibility to &lt;strong>set cookies&lt;/strong> that extend beyond &lt;a href="https://www.cookiestatus.com/safari/#first-party-cookies">ITP&amp;rsquo;s restrictions&lt;/a>, and reduced stress on an already very likely overloaded &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">&lt;strong>Content Security Policy&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to map multiple custom domains to your Google Cloud Project application. I&amp;rsquo;ll also show you how to configure the container to support previewing all these different domains.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Create A Cookie Rewrite Web Service Using The Google Cloud Platform</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/google-cloud/create-cookie-rewrite-web-service-google-cloud/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2019 07:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/google-cloud/create-cookie-rewrite-web-service-google-cloud/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Last updated 11 September 2020&lt;/strong>: Added &lt;a href="#step-4-map-the-custom-domain-to-the-endpoint">important note&lt;/a> about how the custom domain should be mapped with A/AAAA DNS records rather than a CNAME record.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ah, Safari&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://webkit.org/blog/category/privacy/">Intelligent Tracking Prevention&lt;/a> - the gift that &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/itp-2-1-and-web-analytics/">keeps on giving&lt;/a>. Having almost milked this cow for all it&amp;rsquo;s worth, I was sure there would be little need to revisit the topic. Maybe, I thought, it would be better to just sit back and watch the world burn.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Static Site Search With Hugo + App Engine + Search API + Python</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/web-development/static-site-search-google-app-engine-search-api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 09:39:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/web-development/static-site-search-google-app-engine-search-api/</guid><description>&lt;p>As the year changed to 2018, I decided to abandon &lt;a href="https://www.wordpress.org">WordPress&lt;/a>, which I had been using for over 12 years as my content management system of choice. I had many reasons to do so, but the biggest motivators were the opportunity to try something new and to abandon the bloat and clutter of WordPress for a more simple, more elegant order of things. Spurred on by another adopter, &lt;a href="http://markedmondson.me/">Mark Edmondson&lt;/a>, I decided to give &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> a go (pun intended).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
