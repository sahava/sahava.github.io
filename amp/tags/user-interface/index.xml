&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pagination, where only 50 results are shown per page&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A quick search / filter bar at the top of each list, which lets you narrow the list down to results that match your query&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Pagination&lt;/strong> might be a nuisance in large containers, but it was implemented to improve performance. Fetching the list of assets and rendering them on the screen can be a pretty hefty amount of API work, especially if the container is bloated. By introducing pagination, only 50 items are processed at a time, which speeds up the UI. However, being forced to plow through pages of assets can get tedious.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Revamped User Interface In Google Tag Manager</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/revamped-user-interface-in-google-tag-manager/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2016 15:08:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/revamped-user-interface-in-google-tag-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a crazy week. Just crazy. Not only did &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> introduce &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-tag-manager-workspaces/">Workspaces&lt;/a>, arguably one of its most important releases ever for GTM, but they also revamped the user interface! So very big changes have been underfoot, and I&amp;rsquo;m so happy to be writing about them, because in my completely biased opinion these changes are amazing and well worth the long wait.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, I want to quickly walk you through what I think are the most meaningful changes in the interface. A lot has changed, but the underlying mechanisms of GTM are still the same. You&amp;rsquo;re still creating Tags, Triggers, and Variables, and you&amp;rsquo;re still debugging the container using Debug Mode. However, the new user interfaces enhances and streamlines the various creation processes in the container, and the new &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-tag-manager-workspaces/">Abandon / View Changes&lt;/a> feature allows you to debug and diff the changes you or your team has made.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google Tag Manager Workspaces</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-tag-manager-workspaces/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2016 15:07:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-tag-manager-workspaces/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, well, well. Welcome to the Enterprise Game, &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>! You know, if you took a look at all the feature requests and complaints that pass through the &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/104865292981489764063">Google+ community&lt;/a> or the &lt;a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/tag-manager">Product Forums&lt;/a>, you&amp;rsquo;d notice that a large portion of them revolve around lack of multi-user and multi-team support in the tool. Well GTM has taken a gigantic leap forward to soothe these concerns, with the release of its latest feature: &lt;strong>WORKSPACES&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
