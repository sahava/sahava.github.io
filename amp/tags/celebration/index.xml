&lt;p>It was accompanied by &lt;a href="https://analytics.googleblog.com/2012/10/google-tag-manager.html">a blog post&lt;/a>, which contained a brief look into many of Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s key features, some of which are still relevant today.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>Google Tag Manager is a free tool that consolidates your website tags with a single snippet of code and lets you manage everything from a web interface. You can add and update your own tags, with just a few clicks, whenever you want, without bugging the IT folks or rewriting site code. It gives marketers greater flexibility, and lets webmasters focus on other important tasks.&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>At this time, those of us who started using the tool immediately, or who had been beta-testing it, saw quickly what the key selling point of GTM was. It was a way to &lt;strong>impact change on the website&lt;/strong> as quickly as possible, without having to wait for a release to be verified and pushed live.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
