It&amp;rsquo;s all about uncovering &lt;strong>bounce&lt;/strong> metrics for visits which originate from organic Google search results. In particular, the metric we&amp;rsquo;re interested in is how long user &lt;em>dwelled&lt;/em> on the landing page after arriving from organic Google search &lt;strong>AND&lt;/strong> returned to the search engine results page (SERP) using the browser&amp;rsquo;s back button.&lt;/p>

 &lt;/a>
 

&lt;p>The inspiration for this post came from an audience question at the Best Internet Conference in Lithuania, which I recently attended as a speaker. They were concerned that Google is using Bounce Rate as a search ranking signal, and I was fairly strongly opinionated that it&amp;rsquo;s simply not possible, as all the &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; GA metrics are really easy to manipulate. However, Dr. Pete from Moz wrote about &lt;a href="https://moz.com/blog/the-2-user-metrics-that-matter-for-seo">&lt;em>dwell time&lt;/em>&lt;/a> in 2012, and it makes a lot of sense. Google should be &lt;strong>very&lt;/strong> interested how long the visitor stays out of the SERP when following a link. If users tend to immediately return to the SERP, it&amp;rsquo;s very likely the result was not relevant for them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dynamically Added Meta Data Indexed By Google Crawlers</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/seo/dynamically-added-meta-data-indexed-google-crawlers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2015 11:30:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/seo/dynamically-added-meta-data-indexed-google-crawlers/</guid><description>&lt;p>Quick history. On May 23, 2014, the following announcement was made on the Google Webmaster Central Blog:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>In order to solve this problem, we decided to try to understand pages by executing JavaScript. It's hard to do that at the scale of the current web, but we decided that it's worth it. We have been gradually improving how we do this for some time. In the past few months, our indexing system has been rendering a substantial number of web pages more like an average user's browser with JavaScript turned on.&lt;/blockquote>

When you input a search query, the engine&amp;rsquo;s mission is to provide you with the most relevant information with as few clicks as possible. Often, this means that you&amp;rsquo;ll see the answer to your query directly in the SERP:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>See also Dr. Pete&amp;rsquo;s excellent description of &lt;a href="http://moz.com/blog/101-google-answer-boxes-a-journey-into-the-knowledge-graph">variation in the SERP&lt;/a> (note that this post is from 2013, and not all the data types are relevant today). As you can see, there are many ways for a site to annotate data found within, and that way provide it for Google to utilize if it so chooses. There&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee that your structured data is picked up by the search engine, but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t deter you from marking up your content anyway.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To (Not) Make A Splash</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/web-design/how-to-not-make-a-splash/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2013 19:36:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/web-design/how-to-not-make-a-splash/</guid><description>&lt;p>A word of warning. This is not a developers&amp;rsquo; post, a guide, or a thought experiment. This is a bona fide rant. Sometimes we just need to vent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A couple of weeks ago, I checked one of our (inactive) client&amp;rsquo;s Google Analytics accounts I still had access to. What I saw in the acquisition report was this:&lt;/p>

You&amp;rsquo;re seeing a crazy influx of visitors to your site. Just as you&amp;rsquo;re about to call your boss to accept the promotion, you notice a worrying trend: your new visitors are barely making an impression on conversions from online traffic. What&amp;rsquo;s up with that?

I&amp;rsquo;ve also had the pleasure of playing golf only to realize I&amp;rsquo;m roughly at the same skill level I was at when I first started.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I blame the fact I&amp;rsquo;ve played less than ever before due to some unexpected patellofemoral pain in my right knee (yes, I know it&amp;rsquo;s called the Runner&amp;rsquo;s Knee, but if I know words like patellofemoral, I will use them).

Technique in the sense that SEO comprises a number of &lt;strong>de facto guidelines&lt;/strong> (and accompanying tools) which help improve the &lt;a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=35291">search engine friendliness&lt;/a> of your website.

While making note of the dozens of different ways that the lackluster Pacers were &lt;a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/miami-tops-upstart-indiana-pacers-game-7-earning-033337361.html">taken to the cleaners&lt;/a> by the dominant Miami team (read: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAUMJTv0s9g">LeBron James&lt;/a>), I started churning a funky thought in my head. This beautiful, wonderful, exciting, adrenaline-pumping, superstar-studded, tattoo-galore of a game &lt;strong>must&lt;/strong> be an analogy of something.

I first thought that the task would be a simple one. Just rewrite all the SEO stuff to match the latest trends, add more diagrams, charts, and graphs, and make it more personal by increasing the number of client-specific sections. However, soon I started to question my motives (as I usually do when doing something independently). Are these reports really necessary? Who reads them? What use is the information within? Should I require that my clients fix all the issues I reported or are they just recommendations? Are SEO reports the final product of a project, or do they mark the beginning of a hopefully successful post-audit journey for the client? The questions just kept coming, and in the end I was pretty certain that I had uncovered at least some insight into the business of reporting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SEO In A Nutshell (And Some Tips)</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/seo/seo-in-a-nutshell-and-some-tips/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2013 19:03:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/seo/seo-in-a-nutshell-and-some-tips/</guid><description>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Oh no, not another &amp;lsquo;SEO in a nutshell&amp;rsquo; post!&amp;rdquo; I hear you scream.

&lt;p>For markup to be &lt;strong>valid&lt;/strong>, it needs to conform to the guidelines laid out by the &amp;ldquo;governing body&amp;rdquo; of HTML standardization: the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C. While the Internet anxiously waits for HTML5 to &lt;a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/decision-policy/html5-2014-plan.html">shift in status from candidate to recommendation&lt;/a>, we&amp;rsquo;re stuck with ye olde HTML 4.01 standard (est. 1999) as laid out by W3C. Naturally, HTML5 is already widely supported by &lt;a href="http://html5test.com/results/desktop.html">all the major browsers&lt;/a>, and it can (and should) be incorporated in web design without hesitation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
