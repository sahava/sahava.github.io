I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying my summer vacation, either swimming in the lush blue waters of Finland&amp;rsquo;s lakes or in the murky, greenish, (only slightly toxic) chemistry lab reject also known as the Baltic Sea. I&amp;rsquo;ve also had the pleasure of playing golf only to realize I&amp;rsquo;m roughly at the same skill level I was at when I first started.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I blame the fact I&amp;rsquo;ve played less than ever before due to some unexpected patellofemoral pain in my right knee (yes, I know it&amp;rsquo;s called the Runner&amp;rsquo;s Knee, but if I know words like patellofemoral, I will use them). However, now it&amp;rsquo;s time to OPTIMIZE again! And what better way to start this new season of invigorating blog posts than to tackle one of my favorite subjects: website redesign.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
