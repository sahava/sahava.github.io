      <description>So it&#39;s been a while, I know. I&#39;ve been enjoying my summer vacation, either swimming in the lush blue waters of Finland&#39;s lakes or in the murky, greenish, (only slightly toxic) chemistry lab reject also known as the Baltic Sea.

  I blame the fact I&#39;ve played less than ever before due to some unexpected patellofemoral pain in my right knee (yes, I know it&#39;s called the Runner&#39;s Knee, but if I know words like patellofemoral, I will use them).</description>
