      <description>Agile analytics isn&amp;rsquo;t a novel concept in any shape or form. Things like feedback loops and process-oriented development seem to integrate flawlessly into the analytics paradigm, at least on paper. Heck, there&amp;rsquo;s even the Build-Measure-Learn framework for continuous development. It would be difficult to argue that analytics doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a role in something with measure in the name!

I&amp;rsquo;ve written about it many times before, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much why I want to keep on blogging and writing about analytics and tag management customizations. At eMetrics, I stepped out of my comfort zone of development and implementation, and chose to talk about organization practices.</description>
