      <description>A couple of days ago, I wrote an article on tracking content engagement. Even though the solution itself works, and it&#39;s a really neat trick if I can say so myself, it has its problems.
After all the glory I showered on User Timings in Google Analytics, they have one serious flaw: they cap at 10,000 samples per day. What a ridiculous, arbitrary limit.
In any case, this means that if you have enough traffic to accumulate 10K user timing hits per day, it means that the solution I provided in the previous article will not work for you, as the Pageviews will not be capped, meaning the calculation of Total Engaged Time / Pageviews will be skewed.</description>
