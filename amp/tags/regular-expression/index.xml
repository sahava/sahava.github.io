The Lookup Table does exactly what it promises: lookups. These are exact match operations, which are extremely inexpensive to perform, because they can only have a binary result: either the match exists in the data store being queried or it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. This performance stays constant even if the data store being queried increases in size. However, exact match has one significant problem: it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong>exact&lt;/strong> match. Thus even though the Lookup Table variable is extremely useful, it&amp;rsquo;s missing the flexibility of, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, say, regular expressions. You will be pleased to hear, then, that Google Tag Manager has released a new variable type: the &lt;strong>RegEx Table&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
