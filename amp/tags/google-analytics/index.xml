      <title>Allow And Block Advertising Features In Google Analytics</title>

      <description>After writing yet another customTask article on how to respect client-side opt-out using Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager, the analytics.js core library was enhanced with a new field that makes it all a lot easier to do. The field, allowAdFeatures, lets you either allow or block the request to DoubleClick that is initiated when Advertising Features have been enabled.
In this very short article, I&amp;rsquo;ll quickly show you what the field does and why it&amp;rsquo;s useful.</description>

      <title>13 Useful Custom Dimensions For Google Analytics</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/13-useful-custom-dimensions-for-google-analytics/</link>

      <description>One of my favorite (and most popular) articles in my blog is Improve Data Collection With Four Custom Dimensions. In that article, I show how you can improve the quality and granularity of your Google Analytics data set with just four Custom Dimensions. The reason I chose the four dimensions (Hit Timestamp, Session ID, Client ID, and User ID) is because I firmly believe that they should be in Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; standard set of dimensions, but for some inexplicable reason they aren&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <title>Track Browsing Behavior In Google Analytics</title>

      <description>In this article, Jethro Nederhof of Snowflake Analytics fame and I will introduce you to some pretty neat web browser APIs. The purpose of these APIs is to find out more about how the user navigated to the current page, and what&amp;rsquo;s going on with their browser tabs.
  There are so many things you can do with this new information. You can build proper navigational path reports, rather than rely on the fuzzy and often incoherent flow reports in Google Analytics.</description>

      <title>Send Google Analytics Payload Length As Custom Dimension</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/send-google-analytics-payload-length-as-custom-dimension/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/send-google-analytics-payload-length-as-custom-dimension/</guid>
      <description>Maybe you knew this, maybe you didn&amp;rsquo;t, but requests sent from your website (or app) to Google Analytics have a maximum size. Or, more specifically, the payload size (meaning the actual content body of the request) has a maximum.
This maximum size of the payload is 8192 bytes. This means, basically, that the entire parameter string sent to Google Analytics servers can be no longer than 8192 characters in length.</description>

      <title>customTask - The Guide</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/customtask-the-guide/</guid>
      <description>If you have been reading my blog articles over the past year, you might have noticed a disturbing trend. I&amp;rsquo;ve published 9 articles on customTask since the API was released. It might not sound like much, but I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a single feature in Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager that has so completely convinced me of its usefulness in such a short time.
The customTask API is a feature of the Universal Analytics library (used by Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s tags, too).</description>

      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/edit-google-analytics-tag-settings/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/edit-google-analytics-tag-settings/</guid>
      <description>When the Google Analytics Settings variable was introduced in May 2017, it resulted in a significant change in the Google Analytics tag user interface in Google Tag Manager. The default UI for editing a tag was stripped down of all GA-specific settings, and the new Google Analytics Settings drop-down was the replacement.
Unfortunately, the bulk of Google Tag Manager articles online (including those on this blog) still refer to the old interface in screenshots and instructions.</description>

      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/opt-out-of-google-analytics-tracking/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/opt-out-of-google-analytics-tracking/</guid>
      <description>A while ago I posted a #GTMTips post where I detailed the steps you can take to opt-out of all Google Analytics tracking and the DoubleClick redirects that often follow. It was a fun exercise, but because it relies on preventing requests on a tag-by-tag basis (using the ubiquituous customTask), it can be a chore to handle in large containers.
In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll continue with the theme of opting out from Google Analytics tracking by leveraging a solution provided by the tool itself.</description>

      <title>Send Event And Custom Dimension If Google Optimize Experiment Is Running</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/send-event-custom-dimension-google-optimize-experiment-running/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/send-event-custom-dimension-google-optimize-experiment-running/</guid>
      <description>I really like Google Optimize. It has a fairly intuitive UI, setting up experiments is easy, and there&amp;rsquo;s integrations for both Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics built into the system. It&amp;rsquo;s still a JavaScript-based, client-side A/B-testing tool, so problems with flicker and asynchronous loading are ever-present (though this is somewhat mitigated by the page-hiding snippet).
One issue with the Google Analytics integration is the difficulty of creating segments for sessions where the users were actively participating in the experiment.</description>

      <title>Track Users Who Are Offline In Google Analytics</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-users-who-are-offline-in-google-analytics/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-users-who-are-offline-in-google-analytics/</guid>
      <description>The steady increase in mobile use over the last years has introduced some new challenges for web analytics. It&amp;rsquo;s not just about mismatches in the tracking model (the concept of sessions is even more absurd for apps than it is for desktop browsing), but about something more fundamental, more basic. Think about it: if a visitor visits the website using a mobile device, there&amp;rsquo;s a significant chance of them losing internet connectivity and going unintentionally offline.</description>

      <title>Two New Unofficial GA Add-ons For Google Sheets</title>

      <description>More often than not, much of what we do in web analytics can be automated. This applies especially to implementations, audits, configurations, and reporting. So when I&amp;rsquo;m faced with a menial, manual task that might take hours for me to complete if done by hand, I always look at what could be done with some scripting and API work. I want to introduce a couple of Google Sheets add-ons I&amp;rsquo;ve written and released to the public.</description>

      <title>Track Autocomplete Search In Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-autocomplete-search-google-tag-manager/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 07:40:54 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-autocomplete-search-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>Autocomplete search is a tricky thing to track. The underlying logic is that when the user starts feeding characters into a search form, the search suggests results based on a limited input. If the user is not satisfied with the results, they can continue adding characters to the search, thus increasing the accuracy. Often there&amp;rsquo;s also the option to revert to a regular search with what they&amp;rsquo;ve already written. Tracking this logic in tools like Google Analytics is difficult, because there&amp;rsquo;s really no way to know if the search was successful.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/cross-domain-tracking-with-multiple-ga-trackers/</guid>
      <description>To be fair, this tip isn&amp;rsquo;t just for Google Tag Manager but for regular old on-page Google Analytics as well. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those little things that&amp;rsquo;s corroding your data quality without you ever realizing it. Namely, this tip is about how to handle cross-domain tracking in situations where you are sending data to multiple Google Analytics properties on the same page.
It&amp;rsquo;s a very typical scenario - you have a &amp;ldquo;local&amp;rdquo; property, which tracks only the traffic of the current site, and then a &amp;ldquo;rollup&amp;rdquo; property, where you send data from all your organization&amp;rsquo;s websites.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 20 December 2016: I made some fixes to the solution - be sure to grab the latest code snippet from below!
Having worked in all sorts of Google Analytics projects over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself more and more interested in the technical underpinnings of digital analytics rather than the actual analytical work. We all play to our respective strengths, I guess. For example, there are still many purely technical / technological mysteries surrounding Google Analytics, because much of the data processing is done server-side.</description>

      <description>This article is a collaboration between Simo and Dan Wilkerson. Dan&amp;rsquo;s one of the smartest analytics developers out there, and he&amp;rsquo;s already contributed a great #GTMTips guest post. It&amp;rsquo;s great to have him back here sharing his insight on working with Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP).
So, we&amp;rsquo;re back on AMP! Simo wrote a long, sprawling AMP for Google Tag Manager guide a while ago, and Dan has also contributed to the space with his guide for AMP and Google Analytics.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Mobile Pages Via Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/accelerated-mobile-pages-via-google-tag-manager/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/accelerated-mobile-pages-via-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>Google Tag Manager recently published support for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). This support comes in the form of a new Container type in Google Tag Manager.
  When you create an AMP container in GTM, you are actually setting up an external configuration for AMP, which leverages AMP&amp;rsquo;s own analytics module. As befits Google Tag Manager, creating the configuration is done in the familiar Google Tag Manager user interface, and you have (almost) all the tools of regular Google Tag Manager at your disposal.</description>

      <title>#GTMTips: Fix The Rogue Referral Problem In Single-Page Sites</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/fix-rogue-referral-problem-single-page-sites/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/fix-rogue-referral-problem-single-page-sites/</guid>
      <description>Single-page sites (or single-page apps) typically have just one page load. When navigating the site, subsequent content is either uncovered from the DOM, where it&amp;rsquo;s been in a hidden state, or loaded from the server using HTTP requests that do not invoke a new page refresh. This behavior, however, has some implications for Google Analytics tracking, especially when configured via Google Tag Manager.
The crux of the problem is this: When you create a Google Analytics tracker, the URL of the page (without a possible #hash) from when the tracker was created is sent as the value of the Document Location field with every hit that uses this tracker.</description>

      <title>Introducing GA Spy For Google Analytics</title>

      <description>_This is a guest post by Stephen Harris from Seer Interactive . He was kind enough to share his awesome solution in this blog, so I&amp;rsquo;m very grateful indeed for his contribution._
If Google Tag Manager is loaded as the primary instrument for tracking on a webpage (as it should be), then all webpage tracking could and should be configurable via GTM. But we don&amp;rsquo;t always control the circumstances, and it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to face hardcoded Google Analytics tracking outside of GTM.</description>

      <title>10 JavaScript Concepts For Web Analytics Implementation</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve already written extensively about JavaScript in web analytics implementation. Suffice to say, understanding at least the basics is absolutely necessary to survive in the technical medium of the web browser.
  This article expands on a conference talk I gave at MeasureCamp IX, London a short while ago. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been quite single-minded about the importance of JavaScript in web analytics development, and it was a pleasure for me to get some of that off my chest.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/troubleshooting-cross-domain-tracking-in-google-analytics/</guid>
      <description>Cross-domain tracking, in Google Analytics, is the process of passing information stored in browser cookies from one domain to another. Due to web browsers&amp;rsquo; same-origin policy, a browser cookie is only available to the domain it is written on and all its subdomains (by default). Since Google Analytics uses cookies to persist the Client ID, once the user moves from domain to domain it&amp;rsquo;s important to somehow pass this Client ID, too.</description>

      <description>Last updated 2 March 2018.
Every now and then you might be urged to run Google Tag Manager and/or Google Analytics locally, meaning without the benefit of a web server serving your files. In other words, you&amp;rsquo;re loading an HTML file from your computer in the web browser. You can identify a locally run file by the file:/// protocol in the address bar.
  Now, deploying Google Tag Manager onto that file with the hopes of running Google Analytics requests locally isn&amp;rsquo;t quite simple.</description>

      <description>There are times when I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed with Google&amp;rsquo;s developer documentation, especially for Google Tag Manager. Most of the time they get it right, and I&amp;rsquo;d say around 80% of questions being thrown around the forums can be answered just by reading through the documentation. But there are some cases where the documentation is misleading or even downright dangerous. One of these cases is Enhanced Ecommerce.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be a thorough critique of said documentation, but the tip in this post has to do with one of the examples that the documentation gives for measuring Product Clicks.</description>

      <description>Enhanced Ecommerce is a very useful set of reports in Google Analytics. They extend the standard Ecommerce funnel, which measures only purchases, and allow you to observe products from the very first impression, through various interactions, all the way to the purchase and even beyond, if the user wanted a refund. Google has some solid documentation on how to implement and interpret Enhanced Ecommerce, but if there&amp;rsquo;s one area that would deserve more illumination, it&amp;rsquo;s attribution.</description>

In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to configure Google Tag Manager, so that it works in the restricted sandbox of the Chrome Extension. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to make some tweaks, but it&amp;rsquo;s still perfectly doable.</description>

      <description>I have very little against Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; default dashboards. The reason I shy away from them is because they lack the type of customization I&amp;rsquo;ve come to expect from a dashboarding tool. On top of that, they only let you look at GA data, and I learned early on in my career that focusing on just one vertical is one of the cardinal sins you can make as an analyst.</description>

Many of them are still very valid, but I still wanted to write a follow-up. Times have changed, and GTM is very different from what it was two years ago when I wrote the post.
So in this article, I want to divert your attention to 10 blogs, 10 articles, and 10 people - all which are and/or share excellent Google Tag Manager content on a periodic basis.</description>

So today, after my talk (joint session with the awesome Dave Sottimano), I was listening to the inimitable Mike King give an excellent presentation together with Ari Nahmani on technical skill prerequisites for all digital marketers today. Needless to say, I strongly agree with their view that digital marketing has always been a technical discipline, and the web is getting more and more complex each day that passes.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago, I wrote an article on tracking content engagement. Even though the solution itself works, and it&amp;rsquo;s a really neat trick if I can say so myself, it has its problems.
After all the glory I showered on User Timings in Google Analytics, they have one serious flaw: they cap at 10,000 samples per day. What a ridiculous, arbitrary limit.
In any case, this means that if you have enough traffic to accumulate 10K user timing hits per day, it means that the solution I provided in the previous article will not work for you, as the Pageviews will not be capped, meaning the calculation of Total Engaged Time / Pageviews will be skewed.</description>

      <description>When looking at Google Analytics reports, you&amp;rsquo;d think you get a pretty good idea of how people are interacting with your site, right? I mean, you&amp;rsquo;re tracking events here, pageviews there, and user timings, custom dimensions, custom metrics, and calculated metrics are all part of your daily lingo. But you&amp;rsquo;re also probably aware of how futile this tracking is. After all, all you&amp;rsquo;re seeing are numbers that reflect certain outcomes the visitors have produced on the website, and how these outcomes match against your preconceived goals and objectives, right?</description>

      <description>This is a really cool feature for Google Analytics data collection, of which I&amp;rsquo;ve heard very, very little buzz. It&amp;rsquo;s a way to debug any and all hits sent to the Google Analytics endpoint at https://www.google-analytics.com/collect.
  In all simplicity, you just need to copy the entire URL of the HTTP request to your clipboard, paste it into a web browser, and add /debug between the hostname and /collect.</description>

      <description>In this article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to tackle one of the most frequently asked questions out there:
Can you run Google Analytics using the snippet AND using a Google Tag Manager Tag on the same page?
  There are many facets to this query, so I&amp;rsquo;ll try to tackle as many of them as I possibly can.
First, a terminology rant. You hear lots of talk about &amp;ldquo;on-page&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;inline&amp;rdquo; Google Analytics tracking, as that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s used to describe the non-GTM way of tracking Google Analytics.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with the lingo, cross-domain tracking is a hack used by Google Analytics to circumvent the web browser&amp;rsquo;s same-origin policy. Essentially, the policy dictates that browser cookies can only be shared with a parent domain and all its sub-domains. In other words, domainA.com and domainB.com do not share cookies.
Since Google Analytics calculates sessions and users by using a cookie, this is problematic. If the user navigates from domainA.</description>

Finally, I have some great use cases to share, as well as some useful examples for implementing GTM for iOS. That&amp;rsquo;s right, this is an iOS guide, and, to be more specific, geared towards a successful Swift implementation.
  If you didn&amp;rsquo;t know, Swift is a relatively new programming language, developed by Apple for iOS and OS X programming.</description>

      <description>So, looks like iOS 9 has built-in support for integrating &amp;ldquo;content blocking&amp;rdquo; extensions on your iPhone. Now, blocking ads and other intrusive content is nothing new, nor do I want to get into a debate about whether it&amp;rsquo;s a good thing or not. But as a data geek I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in knowing just what share of my site tracking has some content blocker enabled. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show two tricks (easy and advanced) to expose these content blockers.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s an interesting and hacky use case for you. It&amp;rsquo;s all about uncovering bounce metrics for visits which originate from organic Google search results. In particular, the metric we&amp;rsquo;re interested in is how long user dwelled on the landing page after arriving from organic Google search AND returned to the search engine results page (SERP) using the browser&amp;rsquo;s back button.
  The inspiration for this post came from an audience question at the Best Internet Conference in Lithuania, which I recently attended as a speaker.</description>

      <description>Enhanced Ecommerce is undoubtedly an excellent feature of Google Analytics. It provides us with a set of reports that truly extend the capabilities of funnel-based website analysis. As I&amp;rsquo;ve shown before, it&amp;rsquo;s also very useful for tracking other transactional events on your site, such as content engagement.
  However, here&amp;rsquo;s the thing. It&amp;rsquo;s not very easy to implement. Even if you get everything right according to the documentation, there are still quite a number of pitfalls, and many of the learnings emerge only through experience.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately, iFrames still exist. They are used to embed content from one page into another. Frames are horrible, nasty things, very often riddled with cross-domain problems, performance issues, responsive design obstructions and other crap from the nether pits of hell. Regardless, if you&amp;rsquo;re stuck with an iFrame which also collects data to your Google Analytics property, for example, you probably want to prevent at least the first Page View from firing, since otherwise you&amp;rsquo;ll be double-counting Page Views: once on the main page and once in the iFrame.</description>

A little over a year ago, in April 2014, I wrote the post &amp;ldquo;Advanced Form Tracking In Google Tag Manager&amp;rdquo;, and it&amp;rsquo;s been at the top of my best seller list ever since. Turns out that many people are rightfully passionate about making the web forms on their websites as fluid and intuitive as possible, since a web form is often the only thing that stands between a prospect and their transformation into clienthood.</description>

      <description>Maintaining the list of Referral Exclusions in Google Analytics admin is a pain. Especially if you have a webstore, the number of referral sources you need to exclude to avoid sessions being split can grow really fast. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s not like the list is has the most intuitive UI. Instead of a handy text area where you could just copy-paste stuff, you&amp;rsquo;re left with a horrible line-by-line list, and there&amp;rsquo;s no way of copying lists across properties or anything useful like that.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/measure-cart-value-in-enhanced-ecommerce/</guid>
      <description>One of the glaring omissions in the Enhanced Ecommerce reports of Universal Analytics is the ability to calculate cart value for products. Cart value, here, is the value that has been added to the cart.
This value can be used to query for products that have the highest discrepancy between cart value and generated revenue. These are missed opportunities of the highest caliber.
With some Custom Metrics magic, we can, however, get cart value into our reports, and we can find our most and least &amp;ldquo;effective&amp;rdquo; products with just a glance:</description>

      <description>According to their website, SoundCloud is &amp;ldquo;the world’s leading social sound platform where anyone can create sounds and share them everywhere&amp;rdquo;. For artists, it&amp;rsquo;s a channel for distributing previews of their tracks, and for people like me it&amp;rsquo;s a nice way to do some API tinkering. To each their own, I guess!
  I saw a number of requests in the Google+ Google Tag Manager community about a SoundCloud integration, so I decided to look into it to see if I could just build one.</description>

      <description>Data is difficult. Growing a business is difficult. Measuring success is difficult. And you know what? They should be difficult. Otherwise we&amp;rsquo;d all be equally stupid, whereas now those of us ambitious enough to exert themselves are winning the race.
  And it&amp;rsquo;s not just working with data that&amp;rsquo;s difficult. The whole Web is a mess! Search engine optimization consultants, for example, are trigger-happy in doling out advice about server-side redirects without stopping to consider the implications of what they&amp;rsquo;re recommending.</description>

      <title>The Schema Conspiracy</title>

      <description>A schema is something that data processing platforms such as Google Analytics apply to the raw hit data coming in from the data source (usually a website). The most visible aspect of Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; schema is how it groups, or stitches, the arbitrary, hit-level data coming in from the website into discrete sessions, and these are actually grouped under yet another aggregate bucket: users.
But you already know this. You&amp;rsquo;re looking at metrics like Sessions, Bounce Rate, Conversion Rate, and you&amp;rsquo;re using them or variations of them as KPIs in your dashboards and whatnot.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-non-javascript-visits-google-analytics/</guid>
      <description>One of the big mysteries in browser-based data collection platforms like Google Analytics is what happens when the visitor is not being tracked. This is most obvious in cases where the user explicitly opts out of tracking, when the user does not have JavaScript active in their browser, in bounced sessions, and on exit pages.
Opt-outing means that the user explicitly prohibits a website from tracking them. In some cases, it&amp;rsquo;s possible that opt-out is the default, and the user must explicitly opt-in to allow GA to record their visits.</description>

      <description>If you use Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, or any JavaScript-based data collection or analytics platform, have you ever stopped to wonder how they actually work? I mean, you obviously care about getting the data in, but are you taking the machinations of these tools for granted?
This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about for a long while, because I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure that many who work with these platforms actually understand how the browser and the web page interact.</description>

      <description>I created a new Chrome Extension: Internalize for Google Analytics. This is its very first version. It only works on websites with Universal Analytics.
Click here to download Internalize for Google Analytics v1.0
The idea is that with the extension you can push a custom dimension value to your currently active session. You can then use a profile filter in GA to block traffic with this custom dimension value. It&amp;rsquo;s useful when blocking internal traffic with more traditional means (IP address or various GTM workarounds) won&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

      <description>Content Grouping is a nice new feature from the good folks at Google Analytics. Basically, it allows you to group your content according to a logical structure. You can create up to five Content Groupings, and you can have as many Content Groups within these groupings as you like. The difference between a Content Grouping and Content Group is hierarchy. The second is a member of the first. Read Justin Cutroni&amp;rsquo;s post on Content Groupings to get you started.</description>

      <description>(Last updated March 2014) This post is the final chapter of a trilogy. The ultimate refinement, if you will. It all started with my foray into the murky waters of context, when I tested how weather data could be used to provide extra information about site visits. When I wrote that post, I had two trepidations: 1) does sending the API call with every single page view affect site performance negatively, and 2) does forcing the page view call to wait for the API call to complete affect the quality of visit metrics.</description>

While going over my previous post about using weather conditions to segment data in Google Analytics, I started thinking about performance issues. Since I&amp;rsquo;m using a visit-scope custom dimension, it seems futile to have it send the weather details with every single page load. The odds of the weather changing drastically during one visit are slim (unless you live in the UK), and I have yet to come up with a good reason to change my on-site behavior because the weather changed from a drizzle to a downpour.</description>

[Last updated June 2014] I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen in love with Universal Analytics and Google Tag Manager. Together they form an incredibly powerful tool for marketing professionals. In most cases, I no longer need to post recommendations to my client for yet another page template revision, since with the tag manager in place, I can just add custom code via the admin panel.</description>
