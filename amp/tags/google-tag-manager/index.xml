      <description>With the release of Google Analytics: App + Web, Firebase is suddenly all the rage. The new App + Web property can combine data from your website and mobile apps, as long as the latter uses Google Analytics for Firebase, formerly known as Firebase Analytics.
In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the steps of creating an extremely simple Android application, and we&amp;rsquo;ll then create a Firebase project, and for good measure add Google Tag Manager to the mix.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve last written a bona fide Google Tag Manager trick, so here comes. This was inspired by Bart Gibby&amp;rsquo;s question in Measure Slack.
The purpose is to fetch the latest currency exchange rates from the exchangeratesapi.io service, cache them using sessionStorage, and push the results into dataLayer. From dataLayer, they can then be utilized in Custom JavaScript variables and custom variable templates to perform client-side conversions.</description>

      <title>Getting Started With Google Analytics: App &#43; Web</title>

      <description>Google recently released a new version of Google Analytics called App + Web. Clumsy name aside, this really is for all intents and purposes Google Analytics V2 or Firebase Analytics for the Web. We&amp;rsquo;re not talking about a charming way to do roll-up reporting between Google Analytics for Firebase and Universal Analytics, nor are we talking about an enhancement to Universal Analytics.
  No, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about a new measurement model for web traffic, which has the convenience of being compatible with Google Analytics for Firebase, which you might already have running in your apps.</description>

      <description>With Intelligent Tracking Prevention, the Safari browser is on a crusade against cross-site tracking. One of the most obvious and long-standing ways to battle cross-site tracking has been to block third-party cookies in the web browser, and this is exactly what Safari does by default.
However, Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s Preview mode relies on a third-party cookies, so that it can serve you the draft version of the container while serving the regular, live container to your site visitors.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/introducing-gtm-templates-library/</guid>
      <description>When Custom Templates were released in Google Tag Manager, many of us active in the GTM communities started doing two things: 1) creating our own custom templates, and 2) waiting patiently for Google to release a &amp;ldquo;gallery&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;library&amp;rdquo; for distributing these community contributions.
While I have full faith in the latter happening some time in the future, I thought it would be fun to create something similar to a library, and then open-sourcing it for the community to help out with or to download locally for their own purposes.</description>

      <title>How To Build A Google Tag Manager Monitor</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-tag-manager-monitor/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/google-tag-manager-monitor/</guid>
      <description>Google Tag Manager is strictly a tag delivery system, and it&amp;rsquo;s very careful not to collect any analytics data on its own. This is most likely a deliberate choice, because if GTM was to start collecting data, it would introduce additional barriers to adoption.
Nevertheless, being a tool that consolidates the design, development, deployment, and testing of all the marketing and analytics pixels, code snippets, and utilities running on a website or a mobile app, lacking the necessary features for auditing and monitoring has always seemed like an oversight.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Ecommerce Object Builder Template For Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-builder-custom-variable-template/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-builder-custom-variable-template/</guid>
      <description>One of the cool things about Enhanced Ecommerce deployments in Google Tag Manager is that you can use a Custom JavaScript variable to generate the necessary data.
There are many reasons to do so, with the biggest one being the flexibility it offers for manipulating the dataLayer object in case quick changes are required on the site, and it would take too long to wait for a new release of the site JavaScript.</description>

      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/send-page-visibility-state-to-ga/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/send-page-visibility-state-to-ga/</guid>
      <description>One of my pet peeves about Google Analytics has to do with nomenclature. For example, a User isn&amp;rsquo;t really a user but a browser instance, and Direct traffic isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily &amp;ldquo;direct&amp;rdquo; at all, but rather just traffic that has no discernible source. But being so invested in content analytics, my biggest gripe has to do with Pageviews.
A Pageview in Google Analytics is collected when a hit with the hit type pageview is received successfully by the Google Analytics endpoint.</description>

      <description>After the recent release of Custom Templates for Google Tag Manager, my mind has been occupied by very little else. However, I have a nagging feeling that due to how involved the feature set is, there&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of demystifying that needs to take place before templates are fully embraced by the GTM user base.
In this article, I want to show you a concrete example of template creation.</description>

      <description>As I have finally managed to pick up my jaw from the floor, it&amp;rsquo;s now time to tell you what&amp;rsquo;s got me so excited. Google Tag Manager recently released a new feature called Custom Templates. Actually, it&amp;rsquo;s not fair to call it a feature. It&amp;rsquo;s a full-blown paradigm shift in how we use Google Tag Manager. It&amp;rsquo;s a suite of features designed to help brands, companies, and users create and share their own custom JavaScript and HTML setups with ease, while taking care that the code is optimized for delivery in the web browser.</description>

      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/fetch-latest-value-data-layer-variable/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2019 12:00:56 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/fetch-latest-value-data-layer-variable/</guid>
      <description>One of Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s oldest and most reliable features is that it freezes the state of Data Layer variables to the moment when the trigger event occurred. Thus, any tags firing on this trigger (and any variables resolved on this trigger event) will always have access to the same value of each Data Layer variable.
However, there are situations where this is not a good thing. One is tag sequencing, and the other is a scenario where you want to run some custom code that should access the latest value of the Data Layer variable at a moment in time after the tag has already fired.</description>

      <title>CSS Selector Guide For Google Tag Manager</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/css-selector-guide-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>Some four years ago, Google Tag Manager released a new trigger predicate named matches CSS selector. Slowly but surely, it has evolved into one of the most useful little features in GTM.
  Even though I&amp;rsquo;ve written about CSS selectors many times before, I wanted to compile all the relevant information into a single guide. For an external resource, I recommend bookmarking the w3schools.com CSS Selector Reference. But for your day-to-day use of CSS selectors in GTM, this guide will hopefully prove useful.</description>

      <title>Trigger Groups In Google Tag Manager</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/trigger-groups-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>Trigger Group is the newest trigger type you can add to a tag in Google Tag Manager. It allows you to establish dependencies between multiple triggers, not firing the tag until every trigger in the group has fired at least once.
  This establishes an interesting new paradigm in Google Tag Manager, because until now it wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible to create triggers that relied on earlier values of a given key (event in this case).</description>

      <title>Send Event Hits Before Pageview Hits In Google Analytics</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/send-event-before-pageview-in-google-analytics/</guid>
      <description>One of the myths surrounding Google Analytics is that the first hit of a session should always be a pageview. It makes sense - sessions are initialized with a landing page, and thus need a page view to have one.
  However, in this article I want to show you empirically how this myth is just that - a myth.
There is little discernible impact if the first hit of a session is an event, and GA is more than capable of stitching the first event together with the subsequent pageview into a session entity.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/create-utility-variables-returning-functions/</guid>
      <description>In Google Tag Manager, the Custom JavaScript variable is an anonymous function with a return statement. It does not take any parameters, and by default it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to pass any parameters to it, because the Custom JS variable is simply resolved to whatever value the function returns. If it returns a number, for example, passing a parameter to it would make no sense and would result in a TypeError since the variable resolves to a number, not a function.</description>

      <description>Updated 7 March 2019 - Added some extra caveats to this solution. Also, be sure to read my article on ITP 2.1, which has far more detail on what Intelligent Tracking Prevention is and how to work with it.
 Looks like Safari is tightening the noose around browser cookies with the introduction of ITP 2.1 (Intelligent Tracking Prevention). Among other things, ITP 2.1 caps the expiration of client-side cookies to 7 days.</description>

      <description>The jQuery JavaScript library is by almost any means of counting the most popular JavaScript library used in websites around the world. It&amp;rsquo;s so influential, in fact, that its evolution is tightly bound to the JavaScript standardization effort itself, and it&amp;rsquo;s an integral part of the JS Foundation&amp;rsquo;s efforts to build a community for JavaScript developers.
  Google Tag Manager, similarly, is the most popular tag management system used in websites, globally.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-facebook-pixel/</guid>
      <description>A recurring question in the Google Tag Manager communities (e.g. product forums) is how to use an Enhanced Ecommerce dataLayer object with the Facebook pixel code? It&amp;rsquo;s a common question since running a Facebook conversion pixel on a site that also collects data from the store into Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; Enhanced Ecommerce reports is probably a very typical scenario.
 Side note: Since Google+ is about to go the way of the dodo, I&amp;rsquo;ve created an archive of the entire community which you can browse and make text searches against.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Enhanced Ecommerce in Google Analytics. In fact, I think it&amp;rsquo;s the only valid way to deploy Ecommerce tracking today, especially when using Google Tag Manager. The ability to use a Custom JavaScript variable and the possibility to tackle the full ecommerce funnel are some of the benefits of using Enhanced Ecommerce.
However, tracking certain view-based events, impressions in particular, has a significant problem when it comes to how Google Analytics processes events.</description>

      <description>The Custom HTML tag in Google Tag Manager is splendid. It&amp;rsquo;s your go-to tool when you need to run arbitrary JavaScript on the webpage. Some might even use it to actually add HTML elements to the page, but I&amp;rsquo;m willing to bet running JavaScript is its most common use.
However, there&amp;rsquo;s a downside to Custom HTML tags, which is only made more apparent on single-page apps which do not clear the full page when transitioning from one state to another.</description>

      <description>Thanks to the intrepid detective work of Jørn Reidel and Ahmed Marof, it looks like one of the big hurdles for doing a full migration from using the legacy Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager SDKs to the latest Tag Manager + Firebase SDK is now a non-issue.
The issue is, of course, Product-scoped Custom Dimensions or more specifically the lack of support thereof. Until now, I&amp;rsquo;d been holding against recommending the migration to anyone with Enhanced Ecommerce tracking set up simply because the documentation didn&amp;rsquo;t mention the possibility of sending these custom definitions to Google Analytics.</description>

      <description>Perhaps you didn&amp;rsquo;t know this, but there&amp;rsquo;s a really handy demo account for Google Analytics you can use to check out how Google Analytics works in a real business context (the data is from the Google Merchandise Store). However, you can access the account with nothing more than read-only access. This is annoying if you wanted to customize the setup.
Worry not, I have a solution for you! Harnessing the awesome power of customTask, you can create a duplicate of the data collected on any website where you can modify the tracking (e.</description>

      <description>One of the big problems in Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; data model is the immutability of historical data. Once a row of data is written into the data table, it is there practically for good. This is especially annoying in two cases: spam and bogus ecommerce hits. The first is a recognized issue with an open and public data collection protocol, the latter is an annoyance that can explode into full-blown sabotage (you can use the Measurement Protocol to send hundreds of huge transactions to your competitor&amp;rsquo;s GA property, for example).</description>

      <description>Scope in Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; Custom Dimensions refers to how the value in the Custom Dimension is extended to all hits in the same scope.
Hit- and product-scoped Custom Dimensions apply to the given hit alone - they are not extended to any other hits in the session or by the same user.
Session-scoped Custom Dimensions apply the last value sent during the session to all the hits in that session.</description>

      <description>If you are enjoying the Element Visibility trigger as much as I am, you&amp;rsquo;ll be glad to know of a very simple tip that might make your life easier when using Google Tag Manager.
The tip is this: If you&amp;rsquo;ve activated the built-in Click variables, they will be automatically populated with details about the element that caused the Element Visibility trigger to activate!
Tip 92: Use Built-in variables to analyze the visible element   Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s confusing they&amp;rsquo;re still named Click variables, especially since they&amp;rsquo;re duplicated in the Form variables, and even more so since they can be used with the Element Visibility trigger to identify which element became visibility.</description>

  In a nutshell, Google is now starting the process of deprecating the &amp;ldquo;legacy&amp;rdquo; Google Analytics for Mobile Apps. This covers all data collection SDKs that do not have the word &amp;ldquo;Firebase&amp;rdquo; in them.</description>

      <title>Persist Google Tag Manager&#39;s dataLayer Across Pages</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/persist-datalayer-across-pages/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/persist-datalayer-across-pages/</guid>
      <description>Four years ago, I wrote an article on how to persist GTM&amp;rsquo;s dataLayer from page to page. Unfortunately, the solution was a bit clumsy, requiring you to give specific commands for the interactions, which made it really unwieldy in the long run. Google Tag Manager still doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer us a native way to persist the dataLayer array or its internal data model from one page to the other, so I thought it was about time I revisit this idea.</description>

      <description>One of the difficulties of working with Google Tag Manager and the dataLayer structure is that GTM doesn&amp;rsquo;t preserve history of the items collected into its data model. Or, at least, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t preserve it in a manner that would let us access it.
This is typically a very niche problem, but it does surface every now and then. For example, say you wanted to query whether an event with some specific value has already been pushed into dataLayer.</description>

      <description>While using the Google Tag Manager user interface around Halloween 2018, you might have noticed a new tab in Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s Preview mode. The tab is named Errors and shows you the number of exceptions thrown by GTM&amp;rsquo;s tag templates on the page. In this short #GTMTips post, I&amp;rsquo;ll quickly walk you through what the tab shows.
Tip 90: The Errors Tab In Preview Mode   The tab&amp;rsquo;s name is an apt description of what the tab shows.</description>

Now, writing that article wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily my proudest moment. It&amp;rsquo;s not because the solution was poor, but rather because I was suggesting it makes sense to tweak a metric.</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager offers us some nice built-in triggers so that we can automatically listen for specific user interactions on the website, reacting to them however we wish, though typically it would be to fire a tag. The tricky thing especially with the click triggers and form submission tracking is that the page has a nasty habit of redirecting you to the link or form target page before letting you see the respective data in Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s excellent preview mode.</description>

      <description>Enhanced Ecommerce is certainly one of the finest reporting user interface features that Google Analytics has to offer. Enhanced Ecommerce, as the name implies, is a set of dimensions, metrics, and reports, which combine to provide you with a fairly complete view into how users are interacting with your products in your webstore. The main downside of Enhanced Ecommerce is, as with all good things, that it&amp;rsquo;s complicated to implement.</description>

      <description>A very recent addition to Google Tag Manager is the Format Value option in all of GTM&amp;rsquo;s variables. With Format Value, you can modify the output of the variable with a number of pre-defined transformations.
This is extremely handy, because you no longer need to create Custom JavaScript variables whose sole purpose of existence it to change the output of other variables to lowercase, or to change undefined values to fallback strings (e.</description>

      <description>Some years ago, I wrote a post on how to track cross-domain iframes when using Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics. That solution relied on hitCallback to decorate the iframe, and now that I look back on it, it has its shortcomings.
For one, the older solution used hitCallback which, while being reliable in that Google Analytics has definitely loaded with the linker plugin when the method is called, doesn&amp;rsquo;t take into account the possible race condition of the script running before the iframe has been loaded.</description>

      <description>In Google Analytics, the concept of a session is the key aggregation unit of all the data you work with. It&amp;rsquo;s so central to all the key metrics you use (Conversion Rate, Bounce Rate, Session Duration, Landing Page), and yet there&amp;rsquo;s an underlying complexity that I&amp;rsquo;m pretty certain is unrecognized by many of GA&amp;rsquo;s users. And yet, since this idea of a session is so focal to GA (to the point of being overbearing), it&amp;rsquo;s annoying that the browser isn&amp;rsquo;t privy to any of the sessionization parameters that Google Analytics applies to the hits sent from the browser to its servers.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/introducing-customtask-builder/</guid>
      <description>One of the coolest features of Google Analytics and, as a consequence, Google Tag Manager is customTask. It&amp;rsquo;s a method you can use to add and execute code as the hit to Google Analytics is being generated.
I&amp;rsquo;ve written A LOT about customTask, and much of the feedback I&amp;rsquo;ve received has been around the question of how to combine all these different tricks into one customTask script. The problem is, you see, that a tag or hit can only have one customTask script attached to it, so the code within must combine all the different tricks I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing about over the past months.</description>

      <description>Getting cross-domain tracking right in Google Analytics is difficult. Even if you use Google Tag Manager. There are many known issues when cross-domain tracking iframes, for example.
Google Tag Manager implements the cross-domain tracking plugin quite handily via the Universal Analytics tag template, and often the easiest way to track links and form submits is to use the Auto-Link Domains option, as described in this great series of posts on cross-domain tracking by Bounteous.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/two-simple-data-model-tricks/</guid>
      <description>One of the more difficult concepts in Google Tag Manager is the data model. In essence, the data model is what Google Tag Manager uses to populate the Data Layer variable. You might be tempted to think that it&amp;rsquo;s the same thing as the dataLayer array, but it&amp;rsquo;s not.
The data model is a representation of the keys and values you push into dataLayer. Whenever you push any key into dataLayer, GTM grabs this key and updates the corresponding key in its data model with the new value, or in the case of objects and arrays merges the old and the new value together.</description>

Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll cover a nifty trick you can use with the Element Visibility trigger in Google Tag Manager. This tip was inspired by a question from Eugen Potlog in the Google Tag Manager Facebook group.
The use case is that you have an Element Visibility trigger firing for a number of elements all sharing the same CSS selector.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/tag-sequencing-custom-html-tags/</guid>
      <description>Tag sequencing was introdced to Google Tag Manager in late 2015. Its main purpose was to facilitate the sequential firing of tags that have dependencies with each other. Due to the asynchronous nature of third-party libraries like Google Tag Manager, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to establish an order of completion with tags that compete for their chance to fire.
Tag sequencing changed this, as it allows you to establish setup and cleanup tags - the former firing before the main tag, and the latter after.</description>

      <description>One of the great ways to leverage Google Tag Manager in your web analytics tracking is to make use of all the possible custom events that the browser has to offer. One such event is beforeunload. It&amp;rsquo;s dispatched in the browser when the user is about to unload the page. This means, typically, that the user is about to leave the page after clicking a link, or they are about to exit the browser by either closing the tab or the entire window.</description>

      <description>A Content Security Policy (CSP) is something you&amp;rsquo;ll configure your web server with to add an additional layer of protection, especially from harmful scripts loaded from third-party vendors. Once you have a CSP in place, all resources loaded and executed by the web page need to pass the CSP directives. For Google Tag Manager, this is very relevant. If you have a CSP in place, you will need to modify it so that Google Tag Manager functions properly.</description>

      <description>Here we are, reunited with customTask. This time, we&amp;rsquo;ll put this wonderful mechanism to work for a very, very good cause. One of the lesser known &amp;ldquo;features&amp;rdquo; of Google Analytics is that when the payload size (the request body that is actually sent to Google Analytics with each request) goes past a certain limit, specifically 8192 bytes, the hit is aborted without warning. This can come as a surprise, because there&amp;rsquo;s no indication anywhere in Google Analytics that you are missing hits because of this.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a hacky #GTMTips tip for you. Have you ever had a Google Tag Manager container, where you&amp;rsquo;ve been updating your Google Analytics tags over the years? And perhaps these tags (and, today, Google Analytics Settings variables) have been updated with an ever-expanding list of Custom Dimensions? And perhaps this list of Custom Dimensions is sorted willy-nilly, because once you have 50+ rows, it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like a fun thing to do to go over each row and update them so that they are sorted by Custom Dimension index?</description>

      <description>Maybe you knew this, maybe you didn&amp;rsquo;t, but requests sent from your website (or app) to Google Analytics have a maximum size. Or, more specifically, the payload size (meaning the actual content body of the request) has a maximum.
This maximum size of the payload is 8192 bytes. This means, basically, that the entire parameter string sent to Google Analytics servers can be no longer than 8192 characters in length.</description>

      <description>When using the All Elements trigger in Google Tag Manager, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to overlook the fact that it captures all clicks on the page. It&amp;rsquo;s also brutally accurate - it captures clicks on the exact element that was below the mouse button when a click happened. This means that when working with the All Elements trigger, you need to be more careful when identifying the correct element you actually want to track clicks on.</description>

      <description>A while ago, I published a #GTMTips article, where I showed how you can add HTML elements to the page programmatically using Google Tag Manager. This is relevant because GTM&amp;rsquo;s validators prevent you from adding custom parameters to HTML elements that are injected directly via the Custom HTML tag. To circumvent this validation, you need to create the element programmatically, before appending it to the document.
A while ago, Matteo Gamba asked me a question related to the Facebook Customer Chat Plugin.</description>

      <title>Guide To Zones In Google Tag Manager 360</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/guide-zones-google-tag-manager-360/</link>

      <description>Google Tag Manager supports loading multiple containers on the same page. It&amp;rsquo;s useful if you have multiple companies or organizations working on the same site, but for one reason or another (e.g. governance) you want to restrict access to your main container. In these situations, having the other party create their own container and adding it to the site is the best of bad options.
Well, in Google Tag Manager 360, we now have Zones that make managing multiple partners&amp;rsquo; containers quite a bit easier.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/check-container-id-with-eventcallback/</guid>
      <description>When you use the dataLayer.push() command on a page with a Google Tag Manager container, you pass information to GTM&amp;rsquo;s internal data model and potentially fire tags (if the push() contained an event key). You can also add the eventCallback key to these pushes. The value of this key should be a function, and this function is then executed once the container finishes processing any tags that might have fired on that dataLayer.</description>

      <title>Customize The Scroll Depth Trigger In Google Tag Manager</title>

      <description>Last updated 9 March 2018 with some new tips.
The Scroll Depth trigger in Google Tag Manager has a lot going for it. Tracking how far users scroll down a given page has long since been recognized as an important cog in the engagement tracking machine, and there have been really great solutions for implementing scroll depth tracking for web analytics over the years.
With Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s native Scroll Depth trigger, it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to think we now have a be-all end-all solution that covers all the bases.</description>

      <description>One of the annoying quirks of Google Tag Manager is that it strips out any non-standard HTML attributes from elements you add to Custom HTML tags. I&amp;rsquo;m using &amp;ldquo;non-standard&amp;rdquo; as a qualifier here, because I don&amp;rsquo;t have an exhaustive list of attributes that are ignored. But at least data attributes (e.g. data-id) and attributes with custom names (e.g. aria-labelledby) are either stripped out upon injection, or GTM might actually prevent you from even saving the container if the Custom HTML tag has elements with these attributes.</description>

      <description>This is one of those #GTMTips posts that I was certain I&amp;rsquo;d already written. So it came as a mild surprise when I realized I&amp;rsquo;d never tackled this aspect of Google Tag Manager.
It&amp;rsquo;s a short and sweet tip again. Today we&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to check if a variable is undefined using Google Tag Manager.
Tip 73: Check for undefined variable values   If a variable is undefined, it means that a variable with the given name does not currently have any valid value in memory.</description>

If you have been reading my blog articles over the past year, you might have noticed a disturbing trend. I&amp;rsquo;ve published 9 articles on customTask since the API was released. It might not sound like much, but I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a single feature in Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager that has so completely convinced me of its usefulness in such a short time.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/edit-google-analytics-tag-settings/</guid>
      <description>When the Google Analytics Settings variable was introduced in May 2017, it resulted in a significant change in the Google Analytics tag user interface in Google Tag Manager. The default UI for editing a tag was stripped down of all GA-specific settings, and the new Google Analytics Settings drop-down was the replacement.
Unfortunately, the bulk of Google Tag Manager articles online (including those on this blog) still refer to the old interface in screenshots and instructions.</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager should be relatively easy to implement. Just paste the container snippet to the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; of the page and you&amp;rsquo;re good to go! However, at some point you&amp;rsquo;ll want to configure the dataLayer structure, too (read more about dataLayer here). There are two ways to do it: the right way and the wrong way.
In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens if you do it the wrong way, how to identify the issue, and how to fix it.</description>

      <description>A recent guide of mine introduced the Google Analytics adapter in Snowplow. The idea was that you can duplicate the Google Analytics requests sent via Google Tag Manager and dispatch them to your Snowplow analytics pipeline, too. The pipeline then takes care of these duplicated requests, using the new adapter to automatically align the hits with their corresponding data tables, ready for data modeling and analysis.
While testing the new adapter, I implemented a Snowplow pipeline from scratch for parsing data from my own website.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back with another customTask tip, but this time I&amp;rsquo;m exploring some new territory. Snowplow just introduced their latest version update, which included (among other things) an adapter for processing Google Analytics payloads. Never heard of Snowplow? It&amp;rsquo;s a collection of open-source libraries designed to let you build your own analytics pipeline, all the way from data collection, through ETL (extract, transform, load), using custom enrichments and JSON schemas, and finally into your own data warehouse, where you can then analyze the data using whatever tools you find preferable.</description>

      <description>First of all, check out this article for an overview of how custom event listeners work in Google Tag Manager. The reason I&amp;rsquo;m writing this #GTMTips article is that I want to upgrade the solution slightly, and I want to bring it back into the spotlight. Why? Because it&amp;rsquo;s still one of the most effective ways to customize your Google Tag Manager implementation.
A custom event listener is a handler you write with JavaScript.</description>

      <description>Over the past few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding like crazy. The three biggest outcomes of this frenzy have been this new blog design (switched finally away from WordPress and took the plunge back into the world static sites using Hugo), a new Google Sheets add-on for managing Google Tag Manager containers and assets, and a Slack integration in GTM Tools. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll quickly introduce the last two, as I&amp;rsquo;m writing a separate article about the site redesign.</description>

      <description>I really like Google Optimize. It has a fairly intuitive UI, setting up experiments is easy, and there&amp;rsquo;s integrations for both Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics built into the system. It&amp;rsquo;s still a JavaScript-based, client-side A/B-testing tool, so problems with flicker and asynchronous loading are ever-present (though this is somewhat mitigated by the page-hiding snippet).
One issue with the Google Analytics integration is the difficulty of creating segments for sessions where the users were actively participating in the experiment.</description>

      <description>Scroll depth tracking in web analytics is one of those things you simply must do, especially if you have a content-heavy site. Tracking scroll depth not only gives you an indication of how much users are digesting your content, but it also lets you turn meaningless metrics such as Bounce Rate into something far more useful.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve already been tracking scroll depth in Google Tag Manager, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably been using either Rob Flaherty&amp;rsquo;s brilliant Scroll Depth jQuery plugin, or Bounteous&amp;rsquo; equally ingenious Scroll Tracking recipe.</description>

      <description>Holy visibility, Batman! Visibility is a seriously undervalued aspect of web analytics tracking. Too often, we fall into the trap of thinking that &amp;ldquo;Page Views&amp;rdquo; actually have something to do with &amp;ldquo;viewing&amp;rdquo; a page. Or that tracking scrolling to 25%, 50%, or 75% of vastly different pages makes sense on the aggregate level. So you will be very pleased to know that the Google Tag Manager team (who have been on FIRE recently), have just published the Element Visibility trigger.</description>

Google Tag Manager is a free tool that consolidates your website tags with a single snippet of code and lets you manage everything from a web interface.</description>

      <description>Ever since the Lookup Table variable was introduced in Google Tag Manager, users have been craving for more. The Lookup Table does exactly what it promises: lookups. These are exact match operations, which are extremely inexpensive to perform, because they can only have a binary result: either the match exists in the data store being queried or it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. This performance stays constant even if the data store being queried increases in size.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s cut straight to the chase. Google Tag Manager has just released the YouTube Video trigger, which gives you native support for YouTube video tracking. And it&amp;rsquo;s great! Even though we&amp;rsquo;ve been more than satisfied with the excellent tracking scripts provided by e.g. Cardinal Path and Bounteous (with a small modification from yours truly), this is a no-brainer for native support in Google Tag Manager.
  The YouTube Video trigger checks pretty much all the boxes I&amp;rsquo;d expect in a video tracking trigger.</description>

      <description>The steady increase in mobile use over the last years has introduced some new challenges for web analytics. It&amp;rsquo;s not just about mismatches in the tracking model (the concept of sessions is even more absurd for apps than it is for desktop browsing), but about something more fundamental, more basic. Think about it: if a visitor visits the website using a mobile device, there&amp;rsquo;s a significant chance of them losing internet connectivity and going unintentionally offline.</description>

      <description>If you open the Google Tag Manager user interface and browser your tags, triggers, and variables, you might notice that the UI now has two new features:
 Pagination, where only 50 results are shown per page
 A quick search / filter bar at the top of each list, which lets you narrow the list down to results that match your query
  Pagination might be a nuisance in large containers, but it was implemented to improve performance.</description>

      <description>Tracking what a user selects in a drop-down (or select) list/menu can be very useful. This is particularly the case when the selection immediately does something, such as initiate a download or navigate the user to another page. But even if there is no immediate action, it&amp;rsquo;s still interesting to know what selections users might be doing, if only to uncover yet another piece of the engagement puzzle. Here&amp;rsquo;s the Google Tag Manager way to do it!</description>

      <description>Facebook&amp;rsquo;s pixel has an attribute named content_ids (required for Dynamic Ads), which requires an Array of content IDs as its value. It&amp;rsquo;s very possible you&amp;rsquo;re running this pixel on a site which already has Enhanced Ecommerce for Universal Analytics implemented, and now you want to use the same Enhanced Ecommerce data that your developers have already made available in this Facebook pixel.
Or perhaps you want to concatenate a list of strings, such as article tags ([&#39;culture&#39;, &#39;politics&#39;]), and send it as a comma-separated string to Google Analytics (&#39;culture,politics&#39;).</description>

      <description>One of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve recommended from the get-go is to always send the Client ID to Google Analytics with your users&amp;rsquo; hits. This is very useful for adding a level of granularity to your tracking. At first, I recommended using an Event tag to do this. Then I modified my approach a little so that you could send it with your initial Page View (thus not inflating your hit counts).</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it - most of us use Google Tag Manager for one main purpose: to deploy and configure Google Analytics tracking on a website. I&amp;rsquo;d wager that once you start using GTM, you won&amp;rsquo;t be implementing Universal Analytics the old-fashioned way, with on-page code, any more. But running Universal Analytics tags through GTM isn&amp;rsquo;t yet a perfect workflow. We&amp;rsquo;re still missing things like proper plugin support and the option to properly differentiate between the tracker and the hit - both of which are easy to do with an on-page implementation.</description>

      <description>Apart from the unlimited number of workspaces, the 360 Suite version of Google Tag Manager didn&amp;rsquo;t have any differentiation from the free version feature-wise, until today.
  GTM just introduced an approval workflow, which allows you to exercise some additional control over what changes are pushed to the live site, or created into versions.
Note that this update also introduced a small change in the regular GTM UI - mainly, the menu that used to have &amp;ldquo;Create Version&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Publish&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Preview&amp;rdquo; is now changed into a dual button layout with just Preview and Submit as the options.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-autocomplete-search-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>Autocomplete search is a tricky thing to track. The underlying logic is that when the user starts feeding characters into a search form, the search suggests results based on a limited input. If the user is not satisfied with the results, they can continue adding characters to the search, thus increasing the accuracy. Often there&amp;rsquo;s also the option to revert to a regular search with what they&amp;rsquo;ve already written. Tracking this logic in tools like Google Analytics is difficult, because there&amp;rsquo;s really no way to know if the search was successful.</description>

      <description>In this #GTMTips article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at user permissions and access control levels that Google Tag Manager lets you set today. Doing access control right from a user interface AND user experience perspective is really difficult, and GTM is no exception. Nevertheless, there are several levels of user control that you can modify from account and container settings, and it&amp;rsquo;s useful to familiarize with these so that managing a big, sprawling account hierarchy would be just a bit easier.</description>

      <description>With the release of the latest Google Tag Manager API version, it&amp;rsquo;s time to release the new version of GTM Tools. Most of the changes have been done under the hood, with the entire codebase refactored for improved stability.
I released the first toolset in October 2014, and quickly released an updated UI a few months later. Aside from a few bug fixes and stability improvements, the tools have remained largely unchanged since then.</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager has a very nifty programmatic API that lets you do almost anything that&amp;rsquo;s also possible within the GTM UI. I&amp;rsquo;ve used the API a lot, most notably for my GTM Tools, which might be getting a new release soon, too!
The API was recently updated to its second release version (V2), and in this article I want to go over the additions, removals, and changes that the new version introduced.</description>

      <description>To be fair, this tip isn&amp;rsquo;t just for Google Tag Manager but for regular old on-page Google Analytics as well. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those little things that&amp;rsquo;s corroding your data quality without you ever realizing it. Namely, this tip is about how to handle cross-domain tracking in situations where you are sending data to multiple Google Analytics properties on the same page.
It&amp;rsquo;s a very typical scenario - you have a &amp;ldquo;local&amp;rdquo; property, which tracks only the traffic of the current site, and then a &amp;ldquo;rollup&amp;rdquo; property, where you send data from all your organization&amp;rsquo;s websites.</description>

      <description>A couple of years ago I wrote an article on tracking interactions with the SoundCloud widget via Google Tag Manager. When a platform provides a JavaScript embed API, it&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly easy to track interactions with the player. You&amp;rsquo;ve seen this with YouTube, with SoundCloud, with JWPlayer, and now you&amp;rsquo;ll see how to do this with the Mixcloud player.
  If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Mixcloud is, well it&amp;rsquo;s a hugely popular streaming service for DJs, podcasts, radio shows, and other published radio media.</description>

      <description>The beauty of #GTMTips, at least how I&amp;rsquo;ve envisioned them, is that they can be really simple or crazy complex. The important thing is that the idea is conveyed clearly enough. That&amp;rsquo;s why so many of these tips have originated from discussions in our Google Tag Manager Google+ community, the Product Forums, and in private email correspondence with people asking for help. Today&amp;rsquo;s tip, for example, originated from a back-and-forth with Süleyman Okan, so thank you for the inspiration!</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager provides us with a bunch of handy triggers, designed to make capturing user interactions on the website much easier. These triggers are part of a paradigm called auto-event tracking, which comprises the Click, Form, History, and JavaScript Error trigger types.
  Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve covered GTM&amp;rsquo;s triggers many, many times before. If you need a refresher, take a look at the following articles:

      <description>One of the biggest fears I have as a Google Tag Manager user is a broken release of the website (or app) on which I have deployed GTM. Far too often, lack of proper communication practices within an organization lead to a release being pushed out without thoroughly testing how this release impacts any existing tracking solutions.
  Luckily there are ways to mitigate this. The most significant and impactful precautions you can take are all about process:</description>

      <description>I recently published a #GTMTips guide called 10 Useful CSS Selectors, and it was very well received. Inspired by the feedback, here&amp;rsquo;s the next instalment. This time, we&amp;rsquo;re going over some useful JavaScript tips and tricks that you can use to make your Google Tag Manager deployment even more efficient. I&amp;rsquo;ve written a lot about JavaScript in this blog, and I intend to keep on doing so in the future.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/10-useful-css-selectors/</guid>
      <description>Without a doubt, the possibility to leverage CSS selectors in Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s trigger conditions is one of the most useful features of the platform. It gives you an amazing amount of flexibility, especially when combined with GTM&amp;rsquo;s click and form triggers.
Essentially, CSS selectors let you test an HTML Element against a selector string. This check verifies that the element matches the given selector. In practice, this would mean that when you use the click or form trigger, you can check if the Click Element or Form Element built-in variables match a specific selector, allowing you to confirm that the action happened on the correct element.</description>

      <description>A while ago, the Google Tag Manager team published one of my favorite feature releases in the history of GTM: Workspaces. I was so thrilled by this release that I went ahead and published a guide on how to implement and leverage this new feature.
Workspaces is a very comprehensive feature in Google Tag Manager. This is because it changed the entire underlying data model. We no longer work directly with a single container draft.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 20 December 2016: I made some fixes to the solution - be sure to grab the latest code snippet from below!
Having worked in all sorts of Google Analytics projects over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself more and more interested in the technical underpinnings of digital analytics rather than the actual analytical work. We all play to our respective strengths, I guess. For example, there are still many purely technical / technological mysteries surrounding Google Analytics, because much of the data processing is done server-side.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Mobile Pages Via Google Tag Manager</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/accelerated-mobile-pages-via-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>Google Tag Manager recently published support for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). This support comes in the form of a new Container type in Google Tag Manager.
  When you create an AMP container in GTM, you are actually setting up an external configuration for AMP, which leverages AMP&amp;rsquo;s own analytics module. As befits Google Tag Manager, creating the configuration is done in the familiar Google Tag Manager user interface, and you have (almost) all the tools of regular Google Tag Manager at your disposal.</description>

      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/fix-rogue-referral-problem-single-page-sites/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2016 11:58:07 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/fix-rogue-referral-problem-single-page-sites/</guid>
      <description>Single-page sites (or single-page apps) typically have just one page load. When navigating the site, subsequent content is either uncovered from the DOM, where it&amp;rsquo;s been in a hidden state, or loaded from the server using HTTP requests that do not invoke a new page refresh. This behavior, however, has some implications for Google Analytics tracking, especially when configured via Google Tag Manager.
The crux of the problem is this: When you create a Google Analytics tracker, the URL of the page (without a possible #hash) from when the tracker was created is sent as the value of the Document Location field with every hit that uses this tracker.</description>

      <title>Site Speed Sample Rate And Multiple Page Views</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/site-speed-sample-rate-multiple-page-views/</guid>
      <description>Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; Site Speed reports are pretty darn great. They report automatically on various milestones in the process the browser undertakes when rendering content. These reports leverage the Navigation Timing API of the web browser, and they are (typically) collected on the first Page View hit of a page.
And this is all fine. As I said, it&amp;rsquo;s a great feature of Google Analytics, and lends itself handily to spotting issues in the quite complex client-server negotiation that goes on when your web browser requests content from the web server.</description>

      <description>What better way to celebrate the 50th #GTMTips article than, well, a really useful Google Tag Manager tip?! This tip is so useful and simple; it encapsulates everything that I had in mind when starting this series. The tip is about restricting scope of Custom HTML Tags. This is an important concept, because it&amp;rsquo;s possible that you&amp;rsquo;re stuffing your page&amp;rsquo;s global JavaScript namespace with all sorts of junk, and thus inadvertently causing conflicts.</description>

      <description>_This is a guest post by Stephen Harris from Seer Interactive . He was kind enough to share his awesome solution in this blog, so I&amp;rsquo;m very grateful indeed for his contribution._
If Google Tag Manager is loaded as the primary instrument for tracking on a webpage (as it should be), then all webpage tracking could and should be configurable via GTM. But we don&amp;rsquo;t always control the circumstances, and it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to face hardcoded Google Analytics tracking outside of GTM.</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager can be quite the hierarchical mess. You have accounts which comprise containers. Containers are split into container versions, and you use workspaces to create new versions. Phew! Trying to keep tabs on all the activity within these layers can be quite the chore.
In this #GTMTips article, I&amp;rsquo;ll do a quick walkthrough of (almost) all the places where you can review changes made in your Google Tag Manager account and container.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve already written extensively about JavaScript in web analytics implementation. Suffice to say, understanding at least the basics is absolutely necessary to survive in the technical medium of the web browser.
  This article expands on a conference talk I gave at MeasureCamp IX, London a short while ago. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been quite single-minded about the importance of JavaScript in web analytics development, and it was a pleasure for me to get some of that off my chest.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a crazy week. Just crazy. Not only did Google Tag Manager introduce Workspaces, arguably one of its most important releases ever for GTM, but they also revamped the user interface! So very big changes have been underfoot, and I&amp;rsquo;m so happy to be writing about them, because in my completely biased opinion these changes are amazing and well worth the long wait.
In this article, I want to quickly walk you through what I think are the most meaningful changes in the interface.</description>

You know, if you took a look at all the feature requests and complaints that pass through the Google+ community or the Product Forums, you&amp;rsquo;d notice that a large portion of them revolve around lack of multi-user and multi-team support in the tool. Well GTM has taken a gigantic leap forward to soothe these concerns, with the release of its latest feature: WORKSPACES.</description>

      <description>Cross-domain tracking, in Google Analytics, is the process of passing information stored in browser cookies from one domain to another. Due to web browsers&amp;rsquo; same-origin policy, a browser cookie is only available to the domain it is written on and all its subdomains (by default). Since Google Analytics uses cookies to persist the Client ID, once the user moves from domain to domain it&amp;rsquo;s important to somehow pass this Client ID, too.</description>

      <description>Last updated 2 March 2018.
Every now and then you might be urged to run Google Tag Manager and/or Google Analytics locally, meaning without the benefit of a web server serving your files. In other words, you&amp;rsquo;re loading an HTML file from your computer in the web browser. You can identify a locally run file by the file:/// protocol in the address bar.
  Now, deploying Google Tag Manager onto that file with the hopes of running Google Analytics requests locally isn&amp;rsquo;t quite simple.</description>

      <description>There are times when I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed with Google&amp;rsquo;s developer documentation, especially for Google Tag Manager. Most of the time they get it right, and I&amp;rsquo;d say around 80% of questions being thrown around the forums can be answered just by reading through the documentation. But there are some cases where the documentation is misleading or even downright dangerous. One of these cases is Enhanced Ecommerce.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be a thorough critique of said documentation, but the tip in this post has to do with one of the examples that the documentation gives for measuring Product Clicks.</description>

      <description>Enhanced Ecommerce is a very useful set of reports in Google Analytics. They extend the standard Ecommerce funnel, which measures only purchases, and allow you to observe products from the very first impression, through various interactions, all the way to the purchase and even beyond, if the user wanted a refund. Google has some solid documentation on how to implement and interpret Enhanced Ecommerce, but if there&amp;rsquo;s one area that would deserve more illumination, it&amp;rsquo;s attribution.</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager is a great tool. Yeah, you came all the way to this article to read that truism. It also performs really well, loading at a sweet, swift pace even on a slow connection, thanks to pretty decent response times from Google servers. On top of that, the library itself loads asynchronously, meaning the container download doesn&amp;rsquo;t interrupt the browser as it tries to make sense of your messy HTML.</description>

      <description>This article is a guest article by someone from the analytics community I really look up to. Dan Wilkerson is an analytics developer at Bounteous, a company I hold in high esteem. Dan is one of the smartest technical analytics experts out there, and a large bulk of the awesome scripts and hacks that Bounteous produces (almost on a daily basis) have been orchestrated by him. So I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased to give the floor to Dan, so that he can tell you all about using the pesky document.</description>

      <description>Quite a while ago, I wrote an article on what I considered (then) to be my favorite Google Tag Manager resources. Many of them are still very valid, but I still wanted to write a follow-up. Times have changed, and GTM is very different from what it was two years ago when I wrote the post.
So in this article, I want to divert your attention to 10 blogs, 10 articles, and 10 people - all which are and/or share excellent Google Tag Manager content on a periodic basis.</description>

      <description>Back back to the friggin&amp;rsquo; basics. Almost two years ago, I wrote a two-parter on how to have fun with Google Tag Manager: Part 1, and Part 2. The first part had a nice exercise for tracking JavaScript Errors as Google Analytics Events, using the recently published &amp;ldquo;JavaScript Error Listener&amp;rdquo; Tag.
Well, that was in GTM V1. Now we&amp;rsquo;ve been smoothly sailing with the wonderful new interface for well over a year, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to update some of these nifty tricks.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago, I wrote an article on tracking content engagement. Even though the solution itself works, and it&amp;rsquo;s a really neat trick if I can say so myself, it has its problems.
After all the glory I showered on User Timings in Google Analytics, they have one serious flaw: they cap at 10,000 samples per day. What a ridiculous, arbitrary limit.
In any case, this means that if you have enough traffic to accumulate 10K user timing hits per day, it means that the solution I provided in the previous article will not work for you, as the Pageviews will not be capped, meaning the calculation of Total Engaged Time / Pageviews will be skewed.</description>

      <description>When looking at Google Analytics reports, you&amp;rsquo;d think you get a pretty good idea of how people are interacting with your site, right? I mean, you&amp;rsquo;re tracking events here, pageviews there, and user timings, custom dimensions, custom metrics, and calculated metrics are all part of your daily lingo. But you&amp;rsquo;re also probably aware of how futile this tracking is. After all, all you&amp;rsquo;re seeing are numbers that reflect certain outcomes the visitors have produced on the website, and how these outcomes match against your preconceived goals and objectives, right?</description>

      <description>In this article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to tackle one of the most frequently asked questions out there:
Can you run Google Analytics using the snippet AND using a Google Tag Manager Tag on the same page?
  There are many facets to this query, so I&amp;rsquo;ll try to tackle as many of them as I possibly can.
First, a terminology rant. You hear lots of talk about &amp;ldquo;on-page&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;inline&amp;rdquo; Google Analytics tracking, as that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s used to describe the non-GTM way of tracking Google Analytics.</description>

      <description>Hello friends! Today I want to direct your attention to a dangerous setting found within the bowels of the Universal Analytics Tag template in Google Tag Manager. In fact, GTM itself highly discourages you from meddling with it:
  I actually agree with this warning. It should be highly discouraged, as modifying the tracker name introduces a potential hazard to your tracking plan, unless you know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s Data Layer is something I&amp;rsquo;ve touched upon in pretty much all of my articles. It&amp;rsquo;s such an integral part of what makes a tag management solution great and applicable to a host of business scenarios. I&amp;rsquo;ve also talked at length about the internal data model of Google Tag Manager, and this #GTMTips post is very much related to this rather murky concept.
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll go over the Data Layer Variable Version selection, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain just what this selector does.</description>

      <description>Tracking YouTube videos in Google Tag Manager is one of the more useful things you can do in terms of tracking. YouTube has a wonderful API that you can tap into and convert the detected events into dataLayer messages.
There are some really good solutions out there for tracking YouTube videos in GTM:
 The wonderful solution by Cardinal Path.
 An even more thorough treatment by Bounteous.
  Both do a great job of tracking videos that have been loaded with the page.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/gtmtips-track-launch-campaigns-in-gtm-for-ios/</guid>
      <description>In Google Analytics for iOS, there are two types of campaign measurement. There&amp;rsquo;s install campaign measurement, which lets you track the channels which brought your visitors to the App Store, where they proceeded to download your app. There&amp;rsquo;s also launch campaign tracking, which lets you attribute app launches to specific campaigns.
In this tip post, we&amp;rsquo;ll tackle the latter. We&amp;rsquo;ll leverage a feature of the Google Analytics iOS SDK to build the parameters, and then push them to dataLayer so that they can be used in the Tag.</description>

      <description>One of the less-known features of Google Tag Manager, a hidden gem if you will, is the URL Source setting in the URL Variable type. It lets you parse any URL String for its components.
Tip 38: Parse URL strings with the URL Source setting   The setting itself is easy to find. Just edit an existing URL Variable, or create a new one. Then, scroll down to the More Settings divider, expand it, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see the URL Source drop-down list.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/multiple-gtm-containers-on-the-page/</guid>
      <description>For some reason, you might run into a situation where you need to add multiple Google Tag Manager containers on the same page. Usually this is because of poor governance or an inflexible organization. My recommendation is to fix things in your projects first, and only resort to multiple containers if you can&amp;rsquo;t seem to resolve your governance issues using your vocal cords (or your fists).
Officially, Google Tag Manager introduced support for adding multiple containers earlier in 2015.</description>

      <description>(UPDATE 28 Sep 2016: The official recommendation has finally caught up with the times. Now the correct placement for the JavaScript methods of the container snippet is, indeed, in &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;.)
I want to address something I&amp;rsquo;ve been confused about from the very first day since I started using Google Tag Manager. Why on earth would an asynchronously loading JavaScript library be recommended to place in the beginning of &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;, when the logical place to start loading dependencies is as early as possible in the document load process?</description>

      <title>Firing A Single Tag Multiple Times In GTM</title>

      <description>There might be many reasons you&amp;rsquo;d want to fire a single Tag multiple times in Google Tag Manager. The most common one is when you want to deploy multiples of a single tracking point on the web. Perhaps you have a roll-up account you want to send the hits to, in addition to the site-specific tracking property.
Quite a while ago, I gave a solution for this with a specific focus on Google Analytics Tags.</description>

      <description>A while ago I wrote a blog post about how to install Google Tag Manager for iOS using the Swift programming language (you can read the article here). I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of work with Swift lately, and I&amp;rsquo;m more and more convinced that GTM is actually a very powerful utility for running in your iOS app instead of the Google Analytics SDK.
Why? Because it abstracts a lot of the nitty-gritty you&amp;rsquo;d otherwise need to explicitly manage in your GA installation.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/referral-exclusion-on-receipt-page/</guid>
      <description>You might have noticed that the Referral Exclusion List in Google Analytics is difficult to maintain. You can&amp;rsquo;t copy a list from one property to another, the list is a wildcard match for domain names (so all subdomains are automatically excluded), and it&amp;rsquo;s just about the clunkiest user interface we&amp;rsquo;ve seen since ERP tools from the 1990s. A while ago, I wrote of a solution which lets you manage referral exclusions using Google Tag Manager, and it&amp;rsquo;s still a neat trick, as it&amp;rsquo;s way more flexible than said clunky UI.</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager, our favorite free tag management solution, has always struggled with its enterprise-worthiness. There are many features still lacking, most of which have to do with working in multi-user environments. Now, grab the last word of that sentence (see what I did there), and hug it tightly, for GTM just introduced a new, enterprise-friendly feature: Environments.
  These Environments are actually browser cookies, which you use to link a Google Tag Manager container state with the browser of the user who needs to or wants to view that particular state.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/iframe-cross-domain-tracking-in-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>NOTE! This solution has been upgraded, and the new approach can be found here.
 If you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with the lingo, cross-domain tracking is a hack used by Google Analytics to circumvent the web browser&amp;rsquo;s same-origin policy. Essentially, the policy dictates that browser cookies can only be shared with a parent domain and all its sub-domains. In other words, domainA.com and domainB.com do not share cookies.
Since Google Analytics calculates sessions and users by using a cookie, this is problematic.</description>

      <description>So, looks like iOS 9 has built-in support for integrating &amp;ldquo;content blocking&amp;rdquo; extensions on your iPhone. Now, blocking ads and other intrusive content is nothing new, nor do I want to get into a debate about whether it&amp;rsquo;s a good thing or not. But as a data geek I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in knowing just what share of my site tracking has some content blocker enabled. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show two tricks (easy and advanced) to expose these content blockers.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s an interesting and hacky use case for you. It&amp;rsquo;s all about uncovering bounce metrics for visits which originate from organic Google search results. In particular, the metric we&amp;rsquo;re interested in is how long user dwelled on the landing page after arriving from organic Google search AND returned to the search engine results page (SERP) using the browser&amp;rsquo;s back button.
  The inspiration for this post came from an audience question at the Best Internet Conference in Lithuania, which I recently attended as a speaker.</description>

      <description>Every now and then we want to create a bridge between the stateful machines we send data to (e.g. Google Analytics), and the stateless environment where we collect the data itself (e.g. Google Tag Manager). This is not easy. There is no synergy between Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager which would let the latter understand anything about things like sessions or landing pages or Bounce Rates.
One thing we can reliably measure, however, is whether or not the visitor is a New User in Google Analytics.</description>

      <description>Enhanced Ecommerce is undoubtedly an excellent feature of Google Analytics. It provides us with a set of reports that truly extend the capabilities of funnel-based website analysis. As I&amp;rsquo;ve shown before, it&amp;rsquo;s also very useful for tracking other transactional events on your site, such as content engagement.
  However, here&amp;rsquo;s the thing. It&amp;rsquo;s not very easy to implement. Even if you get everything right according to the documentation, there are still quite a number of pitfalls, and many of the learnings emerge only through experience.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately, iFrames still exist. They are used to embed content from one page into another. Frames are horrible, nasty things, very often riddled with cross-domain problems, performance issues, responsive design obstructions and other crap from the nether pits of hell. Regardless, if you&amp;rsquo;re stuck with an iFrame which also collects data to your Google Analytics property, for example, you probably want to prevent at least the first Page View from firing, since otherwise you&amp;rsquo;ll be double-counting Page Views: once on the main page and once in the iFrame.</description>

      <description>(Updated 13 August 2017)
A little over a year ago, in April 2014, I wrote the post &amp;ldquo;Advanced Form Tracking In Google Tag Manager&amp;rdquo;, and it&amp;rsquo;s been at the top of my best seller list ever since. Turns out that many people are rightfully passionate about making the web forms on their websites as fluid and intuitive as possible, since a web form is often the only thing that stands between a prospect and their transformation into clienthood.</description>

      <description>A recent update to Google Tag Manager introduced a feature which has been on the wishlist of many users for a long time. It&amp;rsquo;s called Tag sequencing, and its purpose is to facilitate the sequential firing of Tags. The idea is that you can specify a setup and a cleanup for each Tag in your container.
  This article is intended to function as a quick tour of the feature.</description>

      <title>Two Ways To Persist Data Via Google Tag Manager</title>

      <description>The web is stateless. It&amp;rsquo;s basically blind to your past, and it does a poor job of predicting what you might do in the future. When you browse to a website, the browser requests the page from the web server, and then proceeds to render it for you. This is a detached, clinical process, and any personalized or stateful data transfer is left to the sophistication of your web server.</description>

      <description>With the advent of Enhanced Ecommerce for Universal Analytics, a new scope was introduced for Custom Dimensions and Metrics. Product scope can be used to send information about each product that is sent through Enhanced Ecommerce, but it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly the most logical or intuitive thing to wrap your head around.
In this #GTMTips post, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at how to implement Product-Scoped Custom definitions via Google Tag Manager, and I&amp;rsquo;ll quickly explain how they work in relation to queries and reports you might want to build on top of them.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/block-your-tags-with-trigger-exceptions/</guid>
      <description>To prevent a Tag from firing in Google Tag Manager, you can:
 Delete the Tag
 Remove all Triggers from the Tag
 Add an Exception Trigger to the Tag
  The third option is usually the best if the blocking is just temporary. Exceptions are what used to be called blocking rules in the first version of GTM. To add them is easy enough. In the Fire On step of Tag creation, you can click Create Exceptions, and choose the Trigger that will block this Tag from firing.</description>

      <description>The inimitable Craig Sullivan gave me an idea for a continuation to my latest post on form abandonment tracking. In this short tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to track the time users spend on your form fields. We&amp;rsquo;re going to use the User Timings hit type, and we&amp;rsquo;ll send the data for just one form. With small modifications, you can expand the script to cover multiple forms on a page.</description>

      <title>Track Form Abandonment With Google Tag Manager</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/track-form-abandonment-with-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>Form abandonment isn&amp;rsquo;t always easy to define. Most often, it refers to when someone starts to fill in an HTML form, but leaves the page without submitting it. As a definition, this works nicely. However, with multi-page forms it naturally refers only to the last page of the form. Also, especially with government institutions, forms can be saved to be submitted later. Here, again, form abandonment must be reconsidered.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/gtm-tips/access-array-members-in-the-data-layer/</guid>
      <description>In JavaScript, if you want to access an Array member, you use square bracket notation to retrieve the value stored at a specific index. Indices are numbered in order, with the first index always being at location zero (0). This means that to get the first value stored in Array simo, you&amp;rsquo;d use something like:
var firstValue = simo[0];  In Google Tag Manager, you can push Arrays into the Data Layer.</description>

      <description>Maintaining the list of Referral Exclusions in Google Analytics admin is a pain. Especially if you have a webstore, the number of referral sources you need to exclude to avoid sessions being split can grow really fast. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s not like the list is has the most intuitive UI. Instead of a handy text area where you could just copy-paste stuff, you&amp;rsquo;re left with a horrible line-by-line list, and there&amp;rsquo;s no way of copying lists across properties or anything useful like that.</description>

      <description>What a nice way to wake up to a new day, when brand-spanking new features have been released for Google Tag Manager.
The two features I want to introduce here are Folders in the UI, and code syntax highlighting in Custom HTML Tags and Custom JavaScript Variables.
Folders   Folders is one of those features that has been requested for over and over again since day one. The UI clutter in GTM is a serious problem, especially when dealing with dozens and dozens of items in a single view.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/measure-cart-value-in-enhanced-ecommerce/</guid>
      <description>One of the glaring omissions in the Enhanced Ecommerce reports of Universal Analytics is the ability to calculate cart value for products. Cart value, here, is the value that has been added to the cart.
This value can be used to query for products that have the highest discrepancy between cart value and generated revenue. These are missed opportunities of the highest caliber.
With some Custom Metrics magic, we can, however, get cart value into our reports, and we can find our most and least &amp;ldquo;effective&amp;rdquo; products with just a glance:</description>

      <description>Enhanced Ecommerce is a very nice improvement to the pretty lame, transaction-based Ecommerce tracking in Universal Analytics. Instead of staring blindly at what happens on a receipt page, Enhanced Ecommerce expands your entire webstore into one large funnel labelled &amp;ldquo;Shopping Behavior&amp;rdquo;, and you&amp;rsquo;re able to zoom in on the Checkout funnel as well. Also, the addition of product-scoped tracking is incredibly useful, and it&amp;rsquo;s enabled us to think of any asset (our content, for example) on our site as something we could track through the Enhanced Ecommerce reports.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a tip that&amp;rsquo;s especially important to anyone working with a single-page application. Google Tag Manager persists items in its data model until you either manually delete the variable and/or its value from the data model, or until the user browses away from the page. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing as annoying as the example in the image below, where a value that was set for an earlier Tag is resent with a new Tag, even though the purpose was to leave it out.</description>

      <description>PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is something we need to actively combat against when using Google Analytics, as the platform explicitly forbids sending PII to Google Analytics properties in any size, form, or shape.
One of the most common ways of accidentally passing PII to a property is via query parameters. Many email platforms out there, for example, see no problem in including the user&amp;rsquo;s email address in the query string, especially when the user follows a link in a newsletter.</description>

      <description>According to their website, SoundCloud is &amp;ldquo;the world’s leading social sound platform where anyone can create sounds and share them everywhere&amp;rdquo;. For artists, it&amp;rsquo;s a channel for distributing previews of their tracks, and for people like me it&amp;rsquo;s a nice way to do some API tinkering. To each their own, I guess!
  I saw a number of requests in the Google+ Google Tag Manager community about a SoundCloud integration, so I decided to look into it to see if I could just build one.</description>

      <description>This is a very simple tip, but judging by the number of queries on the Product Forums, it should prove helpful.
Blogger is a free blogging service by Google. Like WordPress, they allow you to run hosted blogs on the blogger.com domain, and they also allow you to modify the HTML source. This, of course, means that you can add the Google Tag Manager code to the HTML template, if you wish (and why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you!</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager has a learning curve. We&amp;rsquo;ve all gone through it. The developer guide as well as the new and improved help center are very useful, but they do not answer all the questions a thorough implementation project might face. There are many ways to find answers to your questions, and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d go through some of my favorite options here.

  And it&amp;rsquo;s not just working with data that&amp;rsquo;s difficult. The whole Web is a mess! Search engine optimization consultants, for example, are trigger-happy in doling out advice about server-side redirects without stopping to consider the implications of what they&amp;rsquo;re recommending.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a very quick tip this time, but one that&amp;rsquo;s caused a lot of headache for many Google Tag Manager users.
Tip 21: Use the All Pages Trigger correctly   Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, All Pages isn&amp;rsquo;t really an intuitive Trigger name. Many seem to interpret it as: enable the Tag to fire on all pages, but use the other Trigger (e.g. Link Click) to actually fire it.
As it turns out, the All Pages Trigger will fire the Tag on all pages.</description>

      <description>If you read my previous post on fetching the Client ID from the Universal Analytics tracker object with Google Tag Manager, you might have agreed with me that it sucks you can&amp;rsquo;t access the tracker object interface in real time using Google Tag Manager. This is because all of the set commands you add to a Universal Analytics tag template take place before the analytics.js is loaded and the tracker object is properly created.</description>

      <description>Since writing my rant about the schema conspiracy of web analytics platforms, I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving the whole idea of hit-level data collection a lot of thought. Sessionization is very heavily implemented in Google Analytics, which is understandable, but the regular Google Analytics API just doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you the kind of information you&amp;rsquo;d need, if you wanted to stitch hits together differently in your own backend. In fact, there are four distinct levels of aggregation that are not exposed via the API, even though I think they should:</description>

In this #GTMtips post, we&amp;rsquo;ll go over the migration steps (it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple), and I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with a couple of tips on how to get started with the new features.</description>

      <description>One of the unfortunate misunderstandings regarding the wonderful Google Tag Manager Preview mode is what it actually means when GTM reports &amp;ldquo;Tags Fired On This Event&amp;rdquo;. For many, this seems to indicate that whatever code the Tag was meant to execute also completed successfully. However, this is not the case.
Tip 19: Debugging Tag execution vs. actual requests   Let&amp;rsquo;s get the distinction straight right away:
Google Tag Manager debug panel tells you when a Trigger has been invoked by certain conditions, and the Tag which uses this Trigger has its JavaScript injected into the Document Object Model.</description>

However, GTM has changed a lot over the last 1.5 years, and I&amp;rsquo;ve made some improvements to the method along the way.</description>

      <description>(Updated 15 July 2015: Added a huge simplification. Jump straight to the update at the end.)
URL fragments are strings of characters that follow a hash mark (#) in the URL. Typically, they are used for anchor links, where following a link keeps you on the same page but jumps the browser to some anchored position. They&amp;rsquo;re also the tool of choice for single-page apps, where content is served dynamically without page reloads.</description>

      <description>In Google Tag Manager, every single Tag requires a Trigger to fire. Every single Trigger requires an Event condition to activate. Sometimes, these Event conditions are obfuscated under template semantics, but you can also create a Custom Event Trigger, where you specify the value of the &amp;lsquo;event&amp;rsquo; key in dataLayer that fires your tag. You can read more about the relationship between GTM events and Tags in these two posts:</description>

      <description>This nifty little solution will let you calculate the time spent on pages that are not tracked in Google Analytics by default. These include both bounced landing pages and exit pages. Bounced pages and exit pages lack the necessary subsequent pageview, which Google Analytics uses to calculate time-based metrics.
Before you go on, read this excellent article by Yehoshua Coren:

Yehoshua gives a very nice use case for the technical solution I&amp;rsquo;m about to explore.</description>

      <description>Due to a recent change in the UI (see entry for February 12, 2015 in the release notes), the large and ever-expanding group of fields you could set for your Universal Analytics tags has been mostly removed. Instead, the often obscure Fields to Set selection has been promoted to the top of More Settings, and you control most of the Universal Analytics fields through this selector.
In this #GTMtips, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick look at what&amp;rsquo;s changed, how it&amp;rsquo;s changed, and how to work with this new, slimmed-down tag template.</description>

      <description>Quick history. On May 23, 2014, the following announcement was made on the Google Webmaster Central Blog:
In order to solve this problem, we decided to try to understand pages by executing JavaScript. It&#39;s hard to do that at the scale of the current web, but we decided that it&#39;s worth it. We have been gradually improving how we do this for some time. In the past few months, our indexing system has been rendering a substantial number of web pages more like an average user&#39;s browser with JavaScript turned on.</description>

      <description>One of the big mysteries in browser-based data collection platforms like Google Analytics is what happens when the visitor is not being tracked. This is most obvious in cases where the user explicitly opts out of tracking, when the user does not have JavaScript active in their browser, in bounced sessions, and on exit pages.
Opt-outing means that the user explicitly prohibits a website from tracking them. In some cases, it&amp;rsquo;s possible that opt-out is the default, and the user must explicitly opt-in to allow GA to record their visits.</description>

So, the time has come to update my GTM Tools. I released the first toolset in October 2014, and it performed its duties just well enough. Sure, the UI was ugly as hell, and there were bugs along the way, but for cloning containers, macros, and rules, and for visualizing containers, it was just good enough.</description>

      <description>Google has a myriad of ways to make the search engine results page (SERP) livelier. When you input a search query, the engine&amp;rsquo;s mission is to provide you with the most relevant information with as few clicks as possible. Often, this means that you&amp;rsquo;ll see the answer to your query directly in the SERP:

      <description>With Google Tag Manager, there are a million different ways to make your tagging setup leaner and more flexible. The reason this should be a priority is because the UI isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect. The more tags you have, the more difficult it becomes to manage your assets.

      <description>(Updated 21 February 2019)
The current version of Google Tag Manager was released in October 2014. With the release, we saw a brand-spanking new UI, a lot of new functionalities (revamped auto-event tracking, for example), plus a new terminology to cope with. We moved away from the programming-centric concepts of Macros and Rules to the more tactile variables and triggers.
It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to rank the changes. The new Auto-Event Tracking is perhaps most impactful, but the improvements done to triggers and variables, when compared to the previous version of GTM, require attention as well.</description>

      <description>In this tip, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at how to leverage a custom first-party cookie to prevent repeat hits of any kind. This is most useful for transactions, since a common problem with Google Analytics (traditional) eCommerce tracking is that a transaction hit is sent again upon subsequent entries to the receipt page, for example using the Back button of the browser. In some cases, and this is not a good practice, a receipt e-mail is sent to the user with a link back to the receipt page, where the transaction is sent over and over again upon entry.</description>

      <description>Updated 27 March 2019
 In the new version of Google Tag Manager, one of the most visible and profound changes to the previous version is how tags are fired (and blocked). First of all, there&amp;rsquo;s the obvious terminological distinction: we talk about triggers now, not rules. Second, triggers have become an integral part of the tag creation workflow, and as such have far more significance in the user interface than before.</description>

      <description>One of the recurring problems in migrating to Google Tag Manager is how to make the transition as smooth as possible. Usually it requires that we agree with the developers on a time when the old code is removed, and at that moment we need to make sure the GTM tags point to the right UA code. This is, of course, only one use case for migrations, as some people do the entire migration in a staging environment, and some just don&amp;rsquo;t care if they lose a little bit of data along the way.</description>

      <description>When our good friends in the Google Tag Manager developer team first introduced the Lookup Table Macro, we were excited. For many of us, it soon became the weapon of choice especially when used as a management and optimization tool for the container itself.
  However, the macro wasn&amp;rsquo;t considered perfect. In fact, the most frequently heard request had to do with the core functionality of the feature itself: the macro should support operations, that is, predicate logic.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written about this before here and here, but this issue remains probably the biggest problem users have when implementing Google Tag Manager.
Tip 10: Resolve conflicts with GTM&amp;rsquo;s listeners   The tip title is actually wrong. You&amp;rsquo;re not fixing Google Tag Manager listeners. Rather, you&amp;rsquo;re resolving conflicts that other scripts on your page might introduce.
GTM&amp;rsquo;s event listening is based on something called event delegation. Event delegation makes use of the document object model (DOM) and its tree-like hierarchy.</description>

      <description>If you use Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, or any JavaScript-based data collection or analytics platform, have you ever stopped to wonder how they actually work? I mean, you obviously care about getting the data in, but are you taking the machinations of these tools for granted?
This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about for a long while, because I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure that many who work with these platforms actually understand how the browser and the web page interact.</description>

      <description>In the new version of Google Tag Manager, auto-event tracking has received a considerable usability upgrade. It might seem quirky at first, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re used to the old auto-event tracking method, but the logic behind the new setup is brilliant.
  The most important distinction is that auto-event tracking isn&amp;rsquo;t something you control with separate tags anymore. Rather, it&amp;rsquo;s now entirely trigger-driven, meaning you activate and specify the auto-event tracking of your choice using tag triggers (triggers are what ye olde folk used to call rules).</description>

      <description>The User ID is definitely one of the coolest things about Universal Analytics, if used correctly. It might reveal some surprising insights about your visitors, since now you&amp;rsquo;re not restricted to analysing visitors as just browser or device instances as before, but rather you can build your stories around all the touch points the user might have had on their journey to and through your web properties.
With this simple tip, you can extend User ID tracking to return users without them needing to authenticate.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written a completely revamped version of this toolset for Google Tag Manager V2.
Well, I just yesterday published the first of my GTM API tools (the Container Visualizer), and I vowed that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t release the other tools for a number of reasons.
The reasons were good, in my opinion (especially the part about the tools being ugly as crap), but on the other hand I don&amp;rsquo;t want to keep anyone away from the amazing potential of the new API.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a tip on how to avoid a horrible, horrible mistake with Google Tag Manager.
Tip 7: Always use .push() with dataLayer   When you assign a value to a variable using the equals ( = ) sign, you are actually reallocating the variable to a new value, and the garbage collection system of the runtime environment sweeps the previous value to bit heaven.
Let&amp;rsquo;s put it simply: if you redefine dataLayer after the GTM container snippet, you will break GTM&amp;rsquo;s proprietary functions.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that setting up eCommerce in Google Tag Manager (and now the new Enhanced ecommerce) is very difficult for many. I&amp;rsquo;m sure part of the problem is that eCommerce is for many users the moment that GTM forces you to take steps in to the developer&amp;rsquo;s domain, since it&amp;rsquo;s obvious that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to add some code to the web page.

      <description>This time we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at two different, JavaScript-y features of Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager. Callback as a concept should be familiar to anyone who&amp;rsquo;s ever used a programming language. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a piece of code that is passed as an argument to some function, so that when this second function has completed, the callback is executed.
For web analytics, callbacks are hugely important, since they allow you to impose a firing order for your asynchronous tags.</description>

      <description>One of the cool things about using a tag management solution is that you can leverage variables like never before. In Google Tag Manager, these variables are referred to as macros, and you can identify a macro with the syntax of {{macro name}}. In this tip I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you can actually call macros from other macros, using a Lookup Table as an example.

As before, I want to write an accompanying post for my session, since there&amp;rsquo;s always so much more to say than the time slot allows for. So, the topic of this article is the data model used by Google Tag Manager to process digital data in your data layer.
This post also picks up where I left in my previous foray into the data layer.</description>

      <title>Use Page Visibility API With GTM</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/use-page-visibility-api-google-tag-manager/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/use-page-visibility-api-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>The Page Visibility API for web browsers is pretty sweet. It lets you poll, using some new properties of the document object, whether or not the current page is visible to the user. Visibility is hidden if the page is not open in the current browser tab instance, or if the browser window has been minimized.
  In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll give an example of how features of the Page Visibility API could be used with Google Tag Manager.</description>

      <description>This might not sound like a tip to you. You might think, &amp;ldquo;Dimensions won&amp;rsquo;t get sent? Sounds like a bug!&amp;rdquo;. You&amp;rsquo;re wrong. This is one of the awesome features of the GA API, and it&amp;rsquo;s key to making your tag setups leaner when sending data to Google Analytics.
Tip 4: Undefined dimensions are left out of GA hits   Note that &amp;lsquo;undefined&amp;rsquo; here means the special value undefined in JavaScript.</description>

This occasion will be heralded by articles such as &amp;ldquo;Data Layer Is Dead&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;This Developer Implemented A Data Layer And You&amp;rsquo;ll Never Guess What Happened Next&amp;rdquo;, and other examples of the kind of content generation whose propagation should be prevented by military force. This is not one of those articles, I hope, but rather an honest look at what Data Layer is from a number of perspectives.</description>

      <description>Rules are the cornerstone of Google Tag Manager. As with any critical element in a system, they are easy to get wrong. This tip is just a refresher on how GTM firing and blocking rules work.
Tip 3: Google Tag Manager rules in a nutshell   So, let&amp;rsquo;s go through these points one-by-one.
Every tag requires a firing rule to work - this is a given. Without a firing rule, your tag will not be written in the document object, and it will never be executed.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple way to check what was the source of the visitor&amp;rsquo;s arrival to the current page. It&amp;rsquo;s done by utilizing the {{referrer}} macro, which comes out-of-the-box in any GTM setup.
Tip 2: Use {{referrer}} to see where the visitor came from   You might want to also explore the Component Types and create new macros for {{referrer path}} and {{referrer host name}} for example:
  By default, you see, the {{referrer}} macro returns the entire URL of the previous page.</description>

      <description>(Update 19 November 2018: See this article for a more elegant solution.)
If you know your JavaScript, you know that all variables, functions, objects, resources, and data in the document get rewritten with every page load. In other words, every single page refresh builds the page from scratch, and the state of the document before the page refresh is left drifting in the ocean of oblivion.
Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s dataLayer is also one such entity.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a much easier, native-to-GTM way to do this now: the Matches CSS Selector.
Behind this tragically boring title is a simple solution to many problems with Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s auto-event tracking. The common denominator to these problems is poor website markup. Selectors are used sparingly, and element hierarchy is messy. This disregard for proper node relationships means you have to resort to Data Layer Variable Macros which look like</description>

      <description>(UPDATE 1 Oct 2014 Due to a change in how macros work in Debug Mode, the {{generic event handler}} macro no longer works when testing in Debug Mode. That means that you&amp;rsquo;ll have to test your custom listener in a live container (I know, ouch!). If you want to test in Debug Mode, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to skip using the {{generic event handler}} as a macro, and instead copy the inner function into the Custom HTML Tag, give the function a name, and use that as the callback in addEventListener or attachEvent.</description>

      <description>Analyzing what people write in your site search field is pretty much one of the smartest things you can do for your website tracking. If certain terms pop up over and over again in internal search reports, it means that your site is not providing the answers people are looking for, meaning you have an excellent opportunity to provide supply for the demand!
  However, not all site search applications are trackable out-of-the-box.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the link to part 2 of this JavaScript guide.
The thing about Google Tag Manager, or any JavaScript tag manager for that matter, is that there&amp;rsquo;s JavaScript involved. In fact, the tool itself is just a JavaScript library with some additional bells and whistles (such as a management UI). This means that to make the best of it, some knowledge of JavaScript is warranted, and that&amp;rsquo;s the point of this post.</description>

Get the latest version of GTM Sonar here.
Just a minor update this time. I added some informative text to the pop-up, along with an error screen if something goes wrong.
  Another change is that now when an element is added to debugDL, a counter on the Browser Action icon will start climbing, representing the number of objects in the array.</description>

 I transferred all debugger actions into a pop-up, which opens when you click the Browser Action.</description>

Many of the Google Tag Manager articles on this blog could be considered hacks, in that they extend the out-of-the-box features of GTM in ways that will surely not be officially supported by Google. The crux of the problem is that lots of folks are taken by surprise when GTM refuses to work properly on their site, or when they have trouble tracking key elements on the page template.</description>

      <description>Over the last couple of posts I&amp;rsquo;ve mainly been doing proof-of-concept (POC) tests with Google Tag Manager. The great thing about a POC is that you don&amp;rsquo;t really need to have any viable results or insight-driving technological innovations. The point is to showcase some feature of the platform on which the experiment was conducted.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll take a care-free step into the world of POCs again. My goal is to do a simple split test in order to identify which variant of a landing page (or key element thereof) produces the most conversions.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to set up a rudimentary email alert system in your Google Tag Manager implementation. Say, for example, you want to receive an email every time an uncaught error occurs on your website. It&amp;rsquo;s not a very good use case, since a large website can spawn hundreds of uncaught exceptions in a short period of time, but let&amp;rsquo;s just pretend for now.
If you know your JavaScript, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that you can&amp;rsquo;t send mail using client-side code.</description>

      <description>If you know your Google Tag Manager, you know that GTM pushes three data layer events into the queue when any page with the container snippet is rendered. Each of these three events signals a specific stage in the page load process. Here are the events (be sure to read my guide on GTM rules to understand further what these events do):
 gtm.js - This is pushed into the data layer as soon as GTM is initialized and the container is loaded.</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s nothing secretive about it, but I&amp;rsquo;m betting many people have no clue what the snippet really does. That&amp;rsquo;s the revelatory part.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve never wondered what the snippet does, then shame on you! Remember, you own your page template. It&amp;rsquo;s yours. Any code that you write there is your responsibility.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably come across a number of guides or posts talking about why it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to block so-called internal traffic from your web analytics reports. The reasons are pretty solid: internal traffic does not emulate normal visitor behavior, it rarely contributes to conversions (skewing up your conversion rate), it inflates page views, and it wreaks havoc on your granular, page-by-page data.
Internal traffic is vaguely described as &amp;ldquo;your employees&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;people really close to your brand&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;your marketing department&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;your web editors&amp;rdquo;, and so on.</description>

      <description>Because I was bored, I did a quick test to sort out the firing order of competing GTM listeners. If you&amp;rsquo;ve done your homework (i.e. read my article on GTM listeners), you&amp;rsquo;ll remember that GTM listeners are set up on the document node of the document object model (DOM). I wanted to test what the firing order is if you have multiple competing listeners on the same page.
I tested with the following listeners (make sure you read up on auto-event tracking if you are completely baffled at this point):</description>

The History Listener is designed to be used on websites where content is loaded dynamically. Typically, these websites make heavy use of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), which is designed for loading content in the background and serving it dynamically without having to reload the page.</description>

      <description>There is a new version of this guide for GTM V2 here.
(Last updated April 2014) I see Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s operational model as an analogy of Montesquieu&amp;rsquo;s three-branched government theory (don&amp;rsquo;t leave just yet, I&amp;rsquo;m getting somewhere with this). We have the legislative power of tags (what should be done), the judiciary power of macros (explore the context and circumstance of each tag), and the executive power of rules (make the tag happen).</description>

      <title>Tag Management Does Not Make IT Redundant</title>

      <description>Here are a few quotes I found on the web regarding tag management and IT departments:
Relief of IT department bottlenecks – once the Tag Manager is deployed, new tags can be implemented directly by Marketing with no IT department involvement. This is a huge benefit for large websites, where IT is oftentimes a bottleneck. Original text here
IT Issues - when you use a TMS like &#39;Google Tag Manager&#39; you are bypassing the IT department.</description>

      <description>When push comes to shove, I&amp;rsquo;m a pretty lazy guy. I enjoy nothing more than just to stretch my legs on a couch, pick up my iPad, and read what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the world. I skip the news, since they&amp;rsquo;re just full of depressing stories. Instead, I head over to my favorite Google+ communities to see what&amp;rsquo;s new in the blogosphere.
  This approach has led me to some pretty amazing individuals, whom I follow like a suckerfish.</description>

      <title>Why Don&#39;t My GTM Listeners Work?</title>

      <description>Ever so often I come across a Google Tag Manager setup where GTM&amp;rsquo;s own auto-event listeners don&amp;rsquo;t perform the task they were supposed to. Listener problems seem to be a hot topic in Google+ and the Product Forums as well.
There may be many reasons why your listeners don&amp;rsquo;t work, but a very common trend is that you have conflicting JavaScript libraries or scripts running on your page.
Let&amp;rsquo;s explore how listeners work before tackling the problem.</description>

      <title>Macro Guide For Google Tag Manager</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written a new Variable Guide for Google Tag Manager, which covers the new GTM UI. This guide is for the old UI.
You might be vaguely familiar with macros if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever used a computer. Basically, whenever you perform a complicated task with a simple gesture, or reuse complex code with a simple input mechanism, you&amp;rsquo;re using macros. Think keyboard shortcuts.
In Google Tag Manager, this is the essence of macros.</description>

      <description>Having just come hot of the press with my latest article on GTM and Content Grouping which, to my delight, Bounteous had written an amazing tutorial on earlier, Brian Kuhn and the amazing Google Tag Manager development team came out with another incredible new feature: The Lookup Table Macro.
In software engineering, a lookup table is an array which takes away a layer of complexity in runtime computation, and replaces it with a simple value assignment based on array indexing.</description>

      <description>Content Grouping is a nice new feature from the good folks at Google Analytics. Basically, it allows you to group your content according to a logical structure. You can create up to five Content Groupings, and you can have as many Content Groups within these groupings as you like. The difference between a Content Grouping and Content Group is hierarchy. The second is a member of the first. Read Justin Cutroni&amp;rsquo;s post on Content Groupings to get you started.</description>

      <description>There is a new version of this post for GTM V2 here.
While going over my previous post about using weather conditions to segment data in Google Analytics, I started thinking about performance issues. Since I&amp;rsquo;m using a visit-scope custom dimension, it seems futile to have it send the weather details with every single page load. The odds of the weather changing drastically during one visit are slim (unless you live in the UK), and I have yet to come up with a good reason to change my on-site behavior because the weather changed from a drizzle to a downpour.</description>

      <description>(Last updated June 2014) Google Analytics provides us with a nifty way of tracking social interactions. With a simple plugin, you can track how many +1s and Likes your pages accumulate.
This guide shows you how to activate social interaction tagging with Google Tag Manager and Universal Analytics. The instructions are for Facebook Likes, Google+ +1s (now deprecated since Google Analytics tracks +1s automatically), Twitter Tweets and Pinterest Pins.</description>

The Google Analytics Summit came and went, and thanks to the Live Stream, everyone could participate. We were treated to a rapid-fire selection of Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; new features, and this post sheds light on one of these in particular: automated event tracking in Google Tag Manager.
Auto-event tracking introduces a nice feature, which does what tag managers ought to do: it provides functionality without HTML template editing.</description>

      <title>Track Adjusted Bounce Rate In Universal Analytics</title>

      <description>So here we are again. Universal Analytics and Google Tag Manager, the dynamic duo, ready to strike again.
First, remember to check my previous two tips for UA and GTM use in custom scenarios:
 Weather as a custom dimension Tracking page load time  In this post, I visit the idea of adjusted bounce rate, which I came across a year ago in the Google Analytics blog.
Adjusted bounce rate basically refers to tweaking the traditional bounce rate collection method (single engagement hits / total visits) so that visits which only included a single page view would not count towards a bounce, as long as they met some qualitative requirements.</description>

      <title>Page Load Time In Universal Analytics</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/page-load-time-universal-analytics/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/page-load-time-universal-analytics/</guid>
      <description>In Google Analytics, you can monitor your site speed and get a decent overview of what pages are contributing positively and negatively to site speed. The problem with page load time metric is that it&amp;rsquo;s an average based on a sample. You can modify the sample rate with setSiteSpeedSampleRate(), but for me that&amp;rsquo;s not bloody well good enough.
(UPDATE 28.3.2014: This post is still valid, but an implementation with User Timings is a much smarter way to measure actual page load time.</description>

      <description>There is a new version of this post for GTM V2 here.
[Last updated June 2014] I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen in love with Universal Analytics and Google Tag Manager. Together they form an incredibly powerful tool for marketing professionals. In most cases, I no longer need to post recommendations to my client for yet another page template revision, since with the tag manager in place, I can just add custom code via the admin panel.</description>
