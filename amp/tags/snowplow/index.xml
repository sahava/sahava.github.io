Instead of instinctively rushing to the &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/custom-html-tag-guide-google-tag-manager/">Custom HTML tag&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/variable-guide-google-tag-manager/#4-custom-javascript">Custom JavaScript variable&lt;/a>, I started considering whether the custom script that needed to be deployed could be transformed into a custom template first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While publishing &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/gallery/#/?filter=gtm-templates-simo-ahava&amp;amp;page=1">numerous templates&lt;/a> into the community gallery, I always spent some time over the past 12 months tinkering on an extremely complicated template translation: the &lt;a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/javascript-tracker">Snowplow Analytics JavaScript tracker&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Install Snowplow On The Google Cloud Platform</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/install-snowplow-on-the-google-cloud-platform/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 07:00:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/install-snowplow-on-the-google-cloud-platform/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Last updated 18 Jan 2019: Added details about the &lt;strong>free tier&lt;/strong> limitations, and showed how to avoid the Dataflow jobs &lt;strong>auto-scaling&lt;/strong> out of control.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m (still) a huge fan of &lt;a href="https://snowplowanalytics.com/">Snowplow Analytics&lt;/a>. Their open-source, modular approach to DIY analytics pipelines has inspired me two write &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/tags/snowplow/">articles&lt;/a> about them, and to host a &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/Snowplow-Analytics-Helsinki/">meetup&lt;/a> in Helsinki. In my previous &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/snowplow-full-setup-with-google-analytics-tracking/">Snowplow with Amazon Web Services guide&lt;/a>, I walked you through setting up a Snowplow pipeline using &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services&lt;/a>. This time around, I&amp;rsquo;m looking at the wondrous &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com">Google Cloud Platform&lt;/a>, for which Snowplow introduced support in an &lt;a href="https://snowplowanalytics.com/blog/2018/03/21/snowplow-r101-neapolis-with-initial-gcp-support/">early 2018 release&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Snowplow: Full Setup With Google Analytics Tracking</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/snowplow-full-setup-with-google-analytics-tracking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2018 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/snowplow-full-setup-with-google-analytics-tracking/</guid><description>&lt;p>A &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/automatically-fork-google-analytics-hits-snowplow/">recent guide&lt;/a> of mine introduced the &lt;a href="https://snowplowanalytics.com/blog/2018/01/25/snowplow-r99-carnac-with-google-analytics-support/">Google Analytics adapter&lt;/a> in &lt;a href="https://snowplowanalytics.com/">Snowplow&lt;/a>. The idea was that you can duplicate the &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics&lt;/a> requests sent via &lt;a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a> and dispatch them to your Snowplow analytics pipeline, too. The pipeline then takes care of these duplicated requests, using the new adapter to automatically align the hits with their corresponding data tables, ready for data modeling and analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While testing the new adapter, I implemented a Snowplow pipeline from scratch for parsing data from my own website. This was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d done the whole process from end-to-end myself, so I thought it might be prudent to document the process for the benefit of others who might want to take a jab at Snowplow but are intimidated by the moving parts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#GTMTips: Automatically Duplicate Google Analytics Hits To Snowplow</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/automatically-fork-google-analytics-hits-snowplow/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 08:30:47 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/amp/analytics/automatically-fork-google-analytics-hits-snowplow/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m back with another &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/amp/tags/customtask/">&lt;code>customTask&lt;/code>&lt;/a> tip, but this time I&amp;rsquo;m exploring some new territory. &lt;a href="https://snowplowanalytics.com/">Snowplow&lt;/a> just introduced their &lt;a href="https://snowplowanalytics.com/blog/2018/01/25/snowplow-r99-carnac-with-google-analytics-support/">latest version update&lt;/a>, which included (among other things) an adapter for processing Google Analytics payloads. Never heard of Snowplow? It&amp;rsquo;s a collection of open-source libraries designed to let you build your own analytics pipeline, all the way from data collection, through ETL (extract, transform, load), using custom enrichments and JSON schemas, and finally into your own data warehouse, where you can then analyze the data using whatever tools you find preferable. Everything is designed to run over &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services&lt;/a>, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to invest in local server hardware or hosting services.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
