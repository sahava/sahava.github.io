      <description>Looks like Safari is tightening the noose around browser cookies with the introduction of ITP 2.1 (Intelligent Tracking Prevention). Among other things, ITP 2.1 caps the expiration of client-side cookies to 7 days. Client-side cookies in this context refer to cookies set with the document.cookie API, which would cover pretty much all cookies set by vendored JavaScript libraries like Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; analytics.js.
Personally, I think anything that forces a rethink of the cookie model is welcome.</description>
