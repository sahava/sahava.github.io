      <description>With the release of Google Analytics: App + Web, Firebase is suddenly all the rage. The new App + Web property can combine data from your website and mobile apps, as long as the latter uses Google Analytics for Firebase, formerly known as Firebase Analytics.
In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the steps of creating an extremely simple Android application, and we&amp;rsquo;ll then create a Firebase project, and for good measure add Google Tag Manager to the mix.</description>

      <description>Thanks to the intrepid detective work of JÃ¸rn Reidel and Ahmed Marof, it looks like one of the big hurdles for doing a full migration from using the legacy Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager SDKs to the latest Tag Manager + Firebase SDK is now a non-issue.
The issue is, of course, Product-scoped Custom Dimensions or more specifically the lack of support thereof. Until now, I&amp;rsquo;d been holding against recommending the migration to anyone with Enhanced Ecommerce tracking set up simply because the documentation didn&amp;rsquo;t mention the possibility of sending these custom definitions to Google Analytics.</description>
