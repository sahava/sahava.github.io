      <description>Ah, Safari&amp;rsquo;s Intelligent Tracking Prevention - the gift that keeps on giving. Having almost milked this cow for all it&amp;rsquo;s worth, I was sure there would be little need to revisit the topic. Maybe, I thought, it would be better to just sit back and watch the world burn.
But then Mr. Charles Farina, a good friend and so amicable he&amp;rsquo;s practically Canadian, tempted me into testing out a quick proof-of-concept web service that would give us back our first party cookies.</description>

      <description>In my intense love affair with the Google Cloud Platform, I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt more inspired to write content and try things out. After starting with a Snowplow Analytics setup guide, and continuing with a Lighthouse audit automation tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you yet another cool thing you can do with GCP.
  In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to use an open-source web crawler running in a Google Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instance to scrape all the internal and external links of a given domain, and write the results into a BigQuery table.</description>

      <description>Google Cloud Platform is very, very cool. It&amp;rsquo;s a fully capable, enterprise-grade, scalable cloud ecosystem which lets even total novices get started with building their first cloud applications. I wrote a long guide for installing Snowplow on the GCP, and you might want to read that if you want to see how you can build your own analytics tool using some nifty open-source modules.
But this guide will not be about Snowplow.</description>
