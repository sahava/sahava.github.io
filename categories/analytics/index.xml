      <title>Google Ads Conversion Tracking With Server-side Tagging In Google Tag Manager</title>

      <description>One of the biggest blockers for Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s server-side tagging to slip out of beta is Google Ads. Until server-side tagging supports a solution for both conversions and remarketing capabilities to be reproduced server-side, it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely that Server containers will lose their beta label.
  While I can&amp;rsquo;t say what will happen to the beta label now, the fact is that Google Tag Manager has now released support for Conversion tracking using server-side tagging.</description>

      <title>Deploy Server-side Google Tag Manager In AWS</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/deploy-server-side-google-tag-manager-aws/</guid>
      <description>Since Google Tag Manager released the manual setup guide for server-side tagging, my mind has been spinning with the idea of walking through the deployment into Amazon&amp;rsquo;s AWS.
I personally prefer Google Cloud Platform over AWS, because I think it&amp;rsquo;s so much more user-friendly. Even though in this guide we&amp;rsquo;ll be utilizing one of the simplest AWS services, Elastic Beanstalk, the deployment is still much more complex than if you were to use GCP&amp;rsquo;s App Engine.</description>

      <title>Consent Settings In Google Tag Manager</title>

      <description>Ever since Google Analytics released the first features of consent mode, I&amp;rsquo;ve been anxiously waiting for news about a more tightly-knit integration with Google&amp;rsquo;s preferred implementation solution: Google Tag Manager.
In a recent release, Google released a veritable cornucopia of new features that should assist in determining and implementing consent not just across Google tags, but any tags running in the container.
  The new features are:
 New consent types (in addition to ad_storage and analytics_storage which were introduced with consent mode).</description>

      <title>Custom GTM Loader For Server-side Tagging</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/custom-gtm-loader-server-side-tagging/</guid>
      <description>Last updated: 2 September 2021. Added details about how Preview containers won&amp;rsquo;t work if you override the Container ID.
 While server-side tagging already has a wonderful built-in Client for proxying the Google Tag Manager container via your own first-party domain, it&amp;rsquo;s not perfect.
The main issues are that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t let you delimit access on a per-origin basis, so requests for the allowlisted container IDs can be sent from anywhere, and that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t let you freely choose the path via which the container ID is loaded.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/recaptcha-v3-server-side-tagging/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written about Google&amp;rsquo;s reCAPTCHA v3 before. It&amp;rsquo;s a verification API, which analyzes the signals fed into it and returns a bot score, based on how &amp;ldquo;bot-like&amp;rdquo; the hits are.
It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to validate whether or not to collect data from certain sources that exhibit bot-like behavior. You&amp;rsquo;ll want to ignore those in your analytics tools, for example, as they tend to add a lot of (unrealistic) noise to the data set.</description>

      <title>Provision Server-side Tagging Application Manually</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/provision-server-side-tagging-application-manually/</guid>
      <description>The automatic provisioning process of the Google Tag Manager server-side tagging service is extremely useful.
With just a few clicks of the button, you can have a fully functional (albeit limited to testing use) server-side tagging endpoint on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
 For a video overview of the automatic deployment, see this video.
 However, the automatic provisioning process creates a new Google Cloud Platform project and, at the time of writing, always deploys the App Engine application (on which the tagging server runs) in the us-central-1 GCP region.</description>

      <title>Facebook Conversions API Using GA4 Web Tags And A GTM Server</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/facebook-conversions-api-gtm-server-side-tagging/</guid>
      <description>Facebook has now officially released their Conversions API tag template for server-side tagging in Google Tag Manager.
With this tag template, you can create a server-side tag that fires with any Client designed to parse requests into a unified event model.
  One such Client already exists, and every single Server container has it built-in: the GA4 Client.
 If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet deployed a Server container, check out this video walkthrough for more details on how to do it.</description>

      <title>Write To Google BigQuery From A GTM Server Container</title>

      <description>Ever since it was released that server-side tagging in Google Tag Manager would run on the Google Cloud Platform stack, my imagination has been running wild.
By running on GCP, the potential for integrations with other GCP components is limitless. The output to Cloud Logging already introduces interesting pipeline opportunities, but now it gets even better.
It&amp;rsquo;s finally possible to write directly to Google BigQuery from a Client or tag template!</description>

      <title>#GTMTips: Tips For Logging In Server-side Tagging</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/tips-for-logging-server-side-tagging/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/tips-for-logging-server-side-tagging/</guid>
      <description>One of the largest costs in a server-side tagging can be logging. Google warns about this in their official documentation, and it&amp;rsquo;s definitely something to keep a keen eye on if your server-side endpoint processes enough data per month.
How much should it process for logging to become an issue? It depends, but you could start seeing some impact once the endpoint processes &amp;gt;1 million incoming requests per month. The best way to find out if logging is a problem is to visit the Billing dashboard in your server-side tagging Google Cloud project and check what the portion of Log Volume is in your monthly costs.</description>

      <description>Updated 26 May 2021: Added details about the new Namespace Objects option in the template.
 Core Web Vitals is described on the dedicated web.dev resource as (emphasis mine):
 &amp;ldquo;Core Web Vitals are the subset of Web Vitals that apply to all pages, should be measured by all site owners, and will be surfaced across all Google tools.&amp;rdquo;
  Recommended Core Web Vitals thresholds - from https://web.dev/vitals/  The Core Web Vitals measurement as suggested by Google are:</description>

      <description>At one point in the turbulent year of 2020, you might have gasped in surprise when looking at the preview interface of Google Tag Manager. No, I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the new preview mode interface.
Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m referring to how the Click Element and Form Element built-in variables would now display a CSS path string rather than the expected [object HTMLDivElement] (or equivalent).
  There was good and bad in this update.</description>

      <description>With the introduction of server-side tagging in Google Tag Manager, the variety of things you can do with your own server-side proxy is mind-boggling:
 Reduce client-side bloat by consolidating data streams and distributing them to vendor endpoints server-side. Improve data security by adding safeguards and validations to prevent harmful data from being sent to vendor endpoints. Enrich data server-side, by combining the incoming data stream with data from APIs and data stores that you own and control.</description>

      <description>Intelligent Tracking Prevention is the name of the tracking prevention mechanism implemented in WebKit and enabled in Safari and all major browsers running on the iOS platform. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about it on this blog, and the CookieStatus.com resource is something you should bookmark for further reading.
The purpose of ITP is to prevent tracking tools&amp;rsquo; access to data stored and processed in the browser. This involves things like blocking all third-party cookies and restricting the lifetime of first-party cookies.</description>

      <title>Implementation Guide For Events In Google Analytics 4</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/implementation-guide-events-google-analytics-4/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/implementation-guide-events-google-analytics-4/</guid>
      <description>On the surface, tracking events in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is fairly simple. Events are, after all, pretty much the only thing you can collect in GA4.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get tied down with endless comparisons to Universal Analytics, though. While I&amp;rsquo;m steadfastly opposed to the idea that GA4 should resemble Universal Analytics, it&amp;rsquo;s still important to cleanse the palate and approach GA4&amp;rsquo;s event tracking with an open mind.
There are some comparisons that can be drawn between the new and the old, but what GA4 might lack in some features and use cases, it more than makes up for this with a more flexible data structure.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/bulk-actions-google-tag-manager-triggers/</guid>
      <description>The release of bulk actions in the Google Tag Manager user interface was very welcome. For years, GTM users had been struggling with a somewhat crippled workflow of item-by-item management.
This release is even more impressive with the most recent update to it: bulk actions with TRIGGERS.
  You can now select multiple tags and attach one or more triggers (or exceptions) to them. Or, conversely, you can use the feature to remove triggers (or exceptions) from tags.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-analytics-4-ecommerce-guide-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>This is an implementation guide for Google Analytics 4. The guide is aimed at Google Tag Manager users and has been designed to complement the official documentation.
  A thing to keep in mind is that Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is still very new. The Google Tag Manager integration is still in its infancy, and implementation places a lot of responsibility on accurate tagging and proper dataLayer instrumentation.
In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain the new data model from an implementation perspective, and walk you through the nuts and bolts on how to get the different parts of GA4&amp;rsquo;s Ecommerce machine to work in unison.</description>

      <description>Last updated 12 February 2021: Clarified how Preview is shared.
 Your favorite tagging platform, Google Tag Manager, now comes equipped with a completely revamped preview mode experience.
Gone are the days of having to minimize the debug pane to prevent it from hogging up screen real estate on the website.
Gone are the days of having to use browser extensions to see what happened in GTM on previous page loads.</description>

      <description>Not too long ago, Google announced a new consent mode for Google tags. It allows you to build a mechanism where Google&amp;rsquo;s tags parse, react, and respond to the consent status of your site visitors.
 Consent Mode with a custom Google Tag Manager template  In short, consent mode is a beta feature, which lets you determine whether or not Google&amp;rsquo;s advertising tags (Ads and Floodlight) and analytics tags (Universal Analytics, App + Web) can utilize browser storage when sending pings to Google&amp;rsquo;s servers.</description>

This time around, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at the upgraded search functionality of the Google Tag Manager user interface, which makes search an actually useful tool. In addition to this, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at one of the most requested features in the history of Google Tag Manager, which we finally have access to: bulk actions!</description>

      <description>Exporting a container in Google Tag Manager can have many purposes. From backing up Google Tag Manager versions to creating and distributing repositories of useful container snapshots, the container export is one of the most useful non-tagging-related tools that the GTM user interface offers.
However, one big misgiving in the feature (until now) has been that exporting just a subset of the container version or workspace has been impossible. It&amp;rsquo;s always the entire container or nothing.</description>

      <description>Last updated 12 August 2021 with details about cross-domain tracking and the FPID cookie.
 With Server-side tagging, the developer community has a chance to vastly improve the data collection capabilities of Google&amp;rsquo;s analytics platforms (Universal Analytics and App+Web). The ability to build our own templates is particularly potent with a Server container.
However, it&amp;rsquo;s not as if Google themselves are just sitting idly by and seeing what the community can come up with.</description>

      <description>Ever since Server-side tagging was publicly announced at SUPERWEEK 2020, Google and the trusted tester community have been hard at work, building something that just might change the landscape of digital analytics for good.
Google Tag Manager has now released Server-side tagging into public beta. In this lengthy article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at what Server-side tagging is, how it should (and should not) be used, and what its implications are on the broader digital analytics community.</description>

 No, Safari 14 (or any other version of Safari) will not block Google Analytics from loading and running on a website.
 In the midst of Apple&amp;rsquo;s yearly Worldwide Developers Conference, the company showcased some of the privacy improvements to the upcoming version of the Safari web browser (version 14).
  In fact, the biggest revelation was the new Privacy Report, which is designed to elucidate how much the browser is working towards mitigating the damage caused by cross-site trackers.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Flickering&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Flash Of Original Content&amp;rdquo; (FOOC) is a phenomenon where there&amp;rsquo;s a (typically) slight but observable delay in the browser updating the site or element layout if the user is included in a variant group for experimentation. This manifests in the original, unmodified element being rendered in the visible portion of the page before the experiment library updates it with the variant.
There are ways to mitigate the flicker:</description>

      <description>When custom templates were released for Google Tag Manager, I updated my workflow for working with GTM. Instead of instinctively rushing to the Custom HTML tag and the Custom JavaScript variable, I started considering whether the custom script that needed to be deployed could be transformed into a custom template first.
While publishing numerous templates into the community gallery, I always spent some time over the past 12 months tinkering on an extremely complicated template translation: the Snowplow Analytics JavaScript tracker.</description>

      <title>Track Interactions In The Shadow DOM Using Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-interactions-in-shadow-dom-google-tag-manager/</link>

      <description>The shadow DOM is a way to add HTML structures to the web page so that they remain isolated from the rest of the document object model (DOM). It&amp;rsquo;s a popular concept with web components, as it allows for encapsulation of web structures so that they aren&amp;rsquo;t affected by style declarations of the parent tree, for example.
  However, being such a &amp;ldquo;hidden&amp;rdquo; structure, anything that happens in the shadow DOM is also hidden from Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s listeners.</description>

      <title>#GTMTips: Simple Way To Exclude Internal Visits From Google Analytics</title>

      <description>With so many people working from home or remotely in these turbulent times, it&amp;rsquo;s time to revisit one of my oldest articles, and discuss the options you have for excluding or segmenting internal traffic in Google Analytics.
The traditional method of IP address exclusion is not necessarily the best option anymore, unless all your employees use a specific VPN to connect to the site.
In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through some of the tools you have at your disposal.</description>

      <title>The New cookieFlags Setting In Google Analytics</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/cookieflags-field-google-analytics/</guid>
      <description>With the enforcement of SameSite settings in the latest versions of Google Chrome, it&amp;rsquo;s become a mad scramble to get cookies working across first-party and third-party contexts. I&amp;rsquo;ve covered this phenomenon before in my SameSite article, as well as in my guide for setting up cookieless tracking for iframes.
Recently, Google Analytics updated its libraries (App+Web, gtag.js, and analytics.js) with a new setting: cookieFlags (analytics.js) or cookie_flags (App+Web and gtag.js).</description>

      <title>Send Hits To The Past With Google Analytics</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/send-hits-past-google-analytics/</guid>
      <description>One of the hard-and-fast rules in Google Analytics is that once hits have been collected and processed into your data properties, those hits are untouchable. This means that if you mistakenly collect duplicate or incorrect transactions, PII traffic, or referral spam, for example, it&amp;rsquo;s extremely difficult, if not downright impossible, to purge or change this data in Google Analytics.
Another staple of Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; strict schema is that displacing hits in time is also very difficult.</description>

      <title>Create Slack Notification System For Google Tag Manager Changes</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/create-slack-notification-system-google-tag-manager-changes/</guid>
      <description>Until recently, I had a feature on GTM Tools that polled the user&amp;rsquo;s Google Tag Manager container(s) for a recently published version. If one was found, a notification was sent to a Slack app, which forwarded it to a workspace and channel of the user&amp;rsquo;s choice.
This was fine, except for the fact that polling the GTM and Slack APIs for dozens upon dozens of containers is a total resource hog, and the only way I can maintain GTM Tools is it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have API leaks like that.</description>

      <description>Updated 25 May 2021: Added information about using this with GA4. As Google Analytics 4 does not have a mechanism to disable cookie storage, only the second solution (send dataLayer events from iframe to the parent) described in this article will work for GA4.
 Here I am, back with &amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt; and cross-domain tracking. I&amp;rsquo;ve published a couple of articles before on the topic, with my upgraded solution being the most recent one.</description>

      <title>The Custom HTML Tag Guide For Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/custom-html-tag-guide-google-tag-manager/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2020 09:00:14 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/custom-html-tag-guide-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>One of the most prominent features of Google Tag Manager since the dawn of time (actually, late 2012) is the Custom HTML tag. This little piece of magic lets Google Tag Manager inject an HTML element to the page. Since time immemorial (still late 2012), it&amp;rsquo;s allowed us to turn Google Tag Manager from a sandboxed prisoner of the native tag templates to a no-holds-barred client-side content management solution.
  In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how the Custom HTML tag works, and what you might be tempted to use it for.</description>

      <title>CDNJS Hosted Libraries Template For Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/cdnjs-hosted-libraries-template-google-tag-manager/</link>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/cdnjs-hosted-libraries-template-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>One of the prime things to use Google Tag Manager for is script injection. Loading a third-party JavaScript library is trivial to do with a Custom HTML tag, and works like a charm.
However, using Custom HTML tags for, well, anything, is no longer the preferred way to add custom code to the site. Custom HTML tags are pretty expensive DOM injections, and they can be incredibly dangerous tools (for UX, security, and privacy) in the wrong and/or inexperienced hands.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/fetch-ip-geolocation-data-using-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>Update 6 April 2020: I updated the template in the gallery to the latest version of the IP Geolocation API SDK, which no longer requires jQuery. Also, the SDK now handles API request caching to browser storage automatically, so the &amp;ldquo;Enable Session Storage&amp;rdquo; option was added to the template.
 My latest custom tag template tackles a use case I&amp;rsquo;ve referred to a number of times before, especially in my article on sending weather data to Google Analytics.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/persist-campaign-data-landing-page/</guid>
      <description>Universal Analytics utilizes two components (by default) to attribute a browser session to a specific campaign: query parameters in the URL and the referrer string.
The page URL is sent with every hit to Google Analytics using the Document location field, which also translates to the &amp;amp;dl parameter in the Measurement Protocol.
The referrer string is sent with a hit to Google Analytics using the Document referrer field, as long as the referrer hostname does not exactly match that of the current page and the referrer string is not empty.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/writing-tests-for-custom-templates-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>Google Tag Manager introduced the capability to add tests to your Custom Templates. Tests, in this context, refer specifically to unit tests that you write in order to make sure your template code works in a predictable way. Unit tests are also used to drive development, ensuring that you have added contingencies for all the different scenarios that the template, when coupled with user input, might introduce.
  In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce how the Tests feature works.</description>

      <title>Custom Parameter Reporting In Google Analytics: App &#43; Web</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/custom-parameter-reporting-google-analytics-app-web/</guid>
      <description>In Google Analytics: App + Web, you collect events. One event differs from another event by the name it uses. An event with the name page_view is different from, say, an event with the name file_download.
This is all run-of-the-mill stuff. You know this.
However, the fundamental change that App + Web introduces, when compared to Universal Analytics, is how event parameters are collected and processed.
  This gets more complicated than it should be.</description>

      <description>There are lots of different readability formulas out there, which seek to provide an index on how readable any given excerpt of text is. Typically, these formulas output a grade-level score, which indicates, roughly, the level of education required to read the text excerpt with ease.
Any &amp;ldquo;quality index&amp;rdquo; that seeks to reduce the complexity of something as multi-faceted as reading should be subject to scrutiny. This is true for Bounce Rate, this is true for Time On Page, and this is true for a readability score.</description>

      <description>There are thousands upon thousands of bots, crawlers, spiders, and other creepy-crawlies out there doing nothing but crawling through websites and harvesting the content within for whatever purposes they have been fine-tuned to. While Google Analytics provides a bot filtering feature to filter out &amp;ldquo;spam&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;bot traffic&amp;rdquo; from views, this is far from comprehensive enough to tackle all instances of bot traffic that might enter the site.
  You might have noticed bot traffic in your data even if you have bot filtering toggled on.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve thoroughly enjoyed writing short (and sometimes a bit longer) bite-sized tips for my #GTMTips topic. With the advent of Google Analytics: App + Web and particularly the opportunity to access raw data through BigQuery, I thought it was a good time to get started on a new tip topic: #BigQueryTips.
For Universal Analytics, getting access to the BigQuery export with Google Analytics 360 has been one of the major selling points for the expensive platform.</description>

      <description>Since the introduction of custom templates in May 2019, the community (myself included) has been anxiously waiting for some official solution for curating and distributing templates created by the community.
Now, finally, we have it. It&amp;rsquo;s called the Community Template Gallery! Read Google&amp;rsquo;s announcement in this blog post.
  I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go over the basics in this article, since Google&amp;rsquo;s own documentation stands fine on its own feet.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/still-running-google-tag-manager-tags/</guid>
      <description>Sometimes, in Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s Debug mode, you&amp;rsquo;ll see tags appear with the status Still Running, and you&amp;rsquo;ll (eventually) notice that these tags are not doing what they are supposed to be doing.
  When you see this message on a tag, it technically means this:
The tag failed to signal Google Tag Manager that it is &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo;.
The technical explanation is, naturally, too simple to be useful. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll explore what &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; means, and how especially Google Analytics tags manifest this behavior.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed working with custom templates for Google Tag Manager. A lot. So much so that whenever the need to add some custom code to a container emerges, my first thought is how to turn that into a custom template.
Google has been forthcoming in introducing new APIs steadily, and I think the variety of things you can do with template is improving with every new API release.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to use a simple tag template for distributing your users to groups, based on a random split.</description>

 Here&amp;rsquo;s yet another article inspired by the fairly recent release of Google Analytics: App + Web properties.

      <description>Google recently released a new version of Google Analytics called App + Web. Clumsy name aside, this really is for all intents and purposes Google Analytics V2 or Firebase Analytics for the Web. We&amp;rsquo;re not talking about a charming way to do roll-up reporting between Google Analytics for Firebase and Universal Analytics, nor are we talking about an enhancement to Universal Analytics.
  No, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about a new measurement model for web traffic, which has the convenience of being compatible with Google Analytics for Firebase, which you might already have running in your apps.</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager is strictly a tag delivery system, and it&amp;rsquo;s very careful not to collect any analytics data on its own. This is most likely a deliberate choice, because if GTM was to start collecting data, it would introduce additional barriers to adoption.
Nevertheless, being a tool that consolidates the design, development, deployment, and testing of all the marketing and analytics pixels, code snippets, and utilities running on a website or a mobile app, lacking the necessary features for auditing and monitoring has always seemed like an oversight.</description>

      <description>One of the cool things about Enhanced Ecommerce deployments in Google Tag Manager is that you can use a Custom JavaScript variable to generate the necessary data.
There are many reasons to do so, with the biggest one being the flexibility it offers for manipulating the dataLayer object in case quick changes are required on the site, and it would take too long to wait for a new release of the site JavaScript.</description>

 As I have finally managed to pick up my jaw from the floor, it&amp;rsquo;s now time to tell you what&amp;rsquo;s got me so excited. Google Tag Manager recently released a new feature called Custom Templates. Actually, it&amp;rsquo;s not fair to call it a feature. It&amp;rsquo;s a full-blown paradigm shift in how we use Google Tag Manager. It&amp;rsquo;s a suite of features designed to help brands, companies, and users create and share their own custom JavaScript and HTML setups with ease, while taking care that the code is optimized for delivery in the web browser.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/css-selector-guide-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>Some four years ago, Google Tag Manager released a new trigger predicate named matches CSS selector. Slowly but surely, it has evolved into one of the most useful little features in GTM.
  Even though I&amp;rsquo;ve written about CSS selectors many times before, I wanted to compile all the relevant information into a single guide. For an external resource, I recommend bookmarking the w3schools.com CSS Selector Reference. But for your day-to-day use of CSS selectors in GTM, this guide will hopefully prove useful.</description>

      <description>Trigger Group is the newest trigger type you can add to a tag in Google Tag Manager. It allows you to establish dependencies between multiple triggers, not firing the tag until every trigger in the group has fired at least once.
  This establishes an interesting new paradigm in Google Tag Manager, because until now it wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible to create triggers that relied on earlier values of a given key (event in this case).</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/send-event-before-pageview-in-google-analytics/</guid>
      <description>One of the myths surrounding Google Analytics is that the first hit of a session should always be a pageview. It makes sense - sessions are initialized with a landing page, and thus need a page view to have one.
  However, in this article I want to show you empirically how this myth is just that - a myth.
There is little discernible impact if the first hit of a session is an event, and GA is more than capable of stitching the first event together with the subsequent pageview into a session entity.</description>

      <description>Updated 1 October 2019 With ITP 2.3 it looks like Safari is reducing the usefulness of localStorage as well, so using that as an alternative fix to persistence issues should not be considered future-proof. this solution should not be considered future-proof.
  Updated 12 March 2019 with some minor clarifications..
 On 21st February 2019, WebKit announced the release of the latest iteration of Safari&amp;rsquo;s Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP), known as ITP 2.</description>

      <description>The jQuery JavaScript library is by almost any means of counting the most popular JavaScript library used in websites around the world. It&amp;rsquo;s so influential, in fact, that its evolution is tightly bound to the JavaScript standardization effort itself, and it&amp;rsquo;s an integral part of the JS Foundation&amp;rsquo;s efforts to build a community for JavaScript developers.
  Google Tag Manager, similarly, is the most popular tag management system used in websites, globally.</description>

 I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Enhanced Ecommerce in Google Analytics. In fact, I think it&amp;rsquo;s the only valid way to deploy Ecommerce tracking today, especially when using Google Tag Manager. The ability to use a Custom JavaScript variable and the possibility to tackle the full ecommerce funnel are some of the benefits of using Enhanced Ecommerce.</description>

      <description>Perhaps you didn&amp;rsquo;t know this, but there&amp;rsquo;s a really handy demo account for Google Analytics you can use to check out how Google Analytics works in a real business context (the data is from the Google Merchandise Store). However, you can access the account with nothing more than read-only access. This is annoying if you wanted to customize the setup.
Worry not, I have a solution for you! Harnessing the awesome power of customTask, you can create a duplicate of the data collected on any website where you can modify the tracking (e.</description>

      <description>One of the big problems in Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; data model is the immutability of historical data. Once a row of data is written into the data table, it is there practically for good. This is especially annoying in two cases: spam and bogus ecommerce hits. The first is a recognized issue with an open and public data collection protocol, the latter is an annoyance that can explode into full-blown sabotage (you can use the Measurement Protocol to send hundreds of huge transactions to your competitor&amp;rsquo;s GA property, for example).</description>

      <description>Scope in Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; Custom Dimensions refers to how the value in the Custom Dimension is extended to all hits in the same scope.
Hit- and product-scoped Custom Dimensions apply to the given hit alone - they are not extended to any other hits in the session or by the same user.
Session-scoped Custom Dimensions apply the last value sent during the session to all the hits in that session.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a user of the free version of Google Analytics, and if you have a free Google Analytics property collecting hits exclusively from the Google Analytics Services SDK (Android or iOS), you might have recently received an email that looks like this (emphasis mine):
  In a nutshell, Google is now starting the process of deprecating the &amp;ldquo;legacy&amp;rdquo; Google Analytics for Mobile Apps. This covers all data collection SDKs that do not have the word &amp;ldquo;Firebase&amp;rdquo; in them.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 4 June 2020: Instead of copying the Custom HTML code from the article, please load it from the GitHub Gist instead.
 Four years ago, I wrote an article on how to persist GTM&amp;rsquo;s dataLayer from page to page. Unfortunately, the solution was a bit clumsy, requiring you to give specific commands for the interactions, which made it really unwieldy in the long run. Google Tag Manager still doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer us a native way to persist the dataLayer array or its internal data model from one page to the other, so I thought it was about time I revisit this idea.</description>

      <description>Over 5 years ago, I wrote an article titled Track Adjusted Bounce Rate In Universal Analytics. It basically explored a number of different methods to tweak the Bounce Rate metric so that it becomes more meaningful in your Google Analytics reports.
Now, writing that article wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily my proudest moment. It&amp;rsquo;s not because the solution was poor, but rather because I was suggesting it makes sense to tweak a metric. The concept of &amp;ldquo;adjusted Bounce Rate&amp;rdquo; sounds like the analyst is fixing a metric to be more beneficial to their cause, rather than fixing the business problem that caused the metric to be poor in the first place.</description>

      <description>Enhanced Ecommerce is certainly one of the finest reporting user interface features that Google Analytics has to offer. Enhanced Ecommerce, as the name implies, is a set of dimensions, metrics, and reports, which combine to provide you with a fairly complete view into how users are interacting with your products in your webstore. The main downside of Enhanced Ecommerce is, as with all good things, that it&amp;rsquo;s complicated to implement.</description>

      <description>**Last updated 18 September 2020: Due to how most browsers now have third-party cookie protections in place, this solution will be very ineffective going forwards. You should instead take a look at a cookieless solution.

      <description>In Google Analytics, the concept of a session is the key aggregation unit of all the data you work with. It&amp;rsquo;s so central to all the key metrics you use (Conversion Rate, Bounce Rate, Session Duration, Landing Page), and yet there&amp;rsquo;s an underlying complexity that I&amp;rsquo;m pretty certain is unrecognized by many of GA&amp;rsquo;s users. And yet, since this idea of a session is so focal to GA (to the point of being overbearing), it&amp;rsquo;s annoying that the browser isn&amp;rsquo;t privy to any of the sessionization parameters that Google Analytics applies to the hits sent from the browser to its servers.</description>

      <description>Here we are, reunited with customTask. This time, we&amp;rsquo;ll put this wonderful mechanism to work for a very, very good cause. One of the lesser known &amp;ldquo;features&amp;rdquo; of Google Analytics is that when the payload size (the request body that is actually sent to Google Analytics with each request) goes past a certain limit, specifically 8192 bytes, the hit is aborted without warning. This can come as a surprise, because there&amp;rsquo;s no indication anywhere in Google Analytics that you are missing hits because of this.</description>

In this very short article, I&amp;rsquo;ll quickly show you what the field does and why it&amp;rsquo;s useful.</description>

In that article, I show how you can improve the quality and granularity of your Google Analytics data set with just four Custom Dimensions. The reason I chose the four dimensions (Hit Timestamp, Session ID, Client ID, and User ID) is because I firmly believe that they should be in Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; standard set of dimensions, but for some inexplicable reason they aren&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Maybe you knew this, maybe you didn&amp;rsquo;t, but requests sent from your website (or app) to Google Analytics have a maximum size. Or, more specifically, the payload size (meaning the actual content body of the request) has a maximum.
This maximum size of the payload is 8192 bytes. This means, basically, that the entire parameter string sent to Google Analytics servers can be no longer than 8192 characters in length. The thing is, if the payload exceeds this, Google Analytics simply drops the hit.</description>

      <description>Agile analytics isn&amp;rsquo;t a novel concept in any shape or form. Things like feedback loops and process-oriented development seem to integrate flawlessly into the analytics paradigm, at least on paper. Heck, there&amp;rsquo;s even the Build-Measure-Learn framework for continuous development. It would be difficult to argue that analytics doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a role in something with measure in the name!
However, past three years of working at Reaktor, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s top agile technology houses, have introduced me to a whole new set of problems with integrating an &amp;ldquo;analytics mindset&amp;rdquo; into an agile workflow, or an &amp;ldquo;agile mindset&amp;rdquo; into the analytics process.</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager supports loading multiple containers on the same page. It&amp;rsquo;s useful if you have multiple companies or organizations working on the same site, but for one reason or another (e.g. governance) you want to restrict access to your main container. In these situations, having the other party create their own container and adding it to the site is the best of bad options.
Well, in Google Tag Manager 360, we now have Zones that make managing multiple partners&amp;rsquo; containers quite a bit easier.</description>

The Scroll Depth trigger in Google Tag Manager has a lot going for it. Tracking how far users scroll down a given page has long since been recognized as an important cog in the engagement tracking machine, and there have been really great solutions for implementing scroll depth tracking for web analytics over the years.
With Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s native Scroll Depth trigger, it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to think we now have a be-all end-all solution that covers all the bases.</description>

      <description>A recent guide of mine introduced the Google Analytics adapter in Snowplow. The idea was that you can duplicate the Google Analytics requests sent via Google Tag Manager and dispatch them to your Snowplow analytics pipeline, too. The pipeline then takes care of these duplicated requests, using the new adapter to automatically align the hits with their corresponding data tables, ready for data modeling and analysis.
While testing the new adapter, I implemented a Snowplow pipeline from scratch for parsing data from my own website.</description>

      <description>When Google released gtag.js, the new, global tracking library designed to (eventually) replace analytics.js, many Universal Analytics practitioners and users were confused (see e.g. Jeff&amp;rsquo;s great overview here). It seemed like gtag.js wasn&amp;rsquo;t really solving any immediate problem, since analytics.js had done a bang-up job with Universal Analytics tracking for all these years. However, gtag&amp;rsquo;s modus operandi is the ability to leverage the same semantic information (distributed across dataLayer!) across a number of Google products, starting with GA and AdWords.</description>

      <description>I really like Google Optimize. It has a fairly intuitive UI, setting up experiments is easy, and there&amp;rsquo;s integrations for both Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics built into the system. It&amp;rsquo;s still a JavaScript-based, client-side A/B-testing tool, so problems with flicker and asynchronous loading are ever-present (though this is somewhat mitigated by the page-hiding snippet).
One issue with the Google Analytics integration is the difficulty of creating segments for sessions where the users were actively participating in the experiment.</description>

      <description>Scroll depth tracking in web analytics is one of those things you simply must do, especially if you have a content-heavy site. Tracking scroll depth not only gives you an indication of how much users are digesting your content, but it also lets you turn meaningless metrics such as Bounce Rate into something far more useful.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve already been tracking scroll depth in Google Tag Manager, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably been using either Rob Flaherty&amp;rsquo;s brilliant Scroll Depth jQuery plugin, or Bounteous&amp;rsquo; equally ingenious Scroll Tracking recipe.</description>

      <title>The Element Visibility Trigger In Google Tag Manager</title>

      <description>Holy visibility, Batman! Visibility is a seriously undervalued aspect of web analytics tracking. Too often, we fall into the trap of thinking that &amp;ldquo;Page Views&amp;rdquo; actually have something to do with &amp;ldquo;viewing&amp;rdquo; a page. Or that tracking scrolling to 25%, 50%, or 75% of vastly different pages makes sense on the aggregate level. So you will be very pleased to know that the Google Tag Manager team (who have been on FIRE recently), have just published the Element Visibility trigger.</description>

      <description>5 years ago, on 1st October 2012, this lovely video popped up in Google&amp;rsquo;s Analytics Blog:
It was accompanied by a blog post, which contained a brief look into many of Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s key features, some of which are still relevant today.
Google Tag Manager is a free tool that consolidates your website tags with a single snippet of code and lets you manage everything from a web interface. You can add and update your own tags, with just a few clicks, whenever you want, without bugging the IT folks or rewriting site code.</description>

      <description>Universal Analytics can collect Page Timing data from users that load your pages. This data is populated in to the Behavior -&amp;gt; Site Speed -&amp;gt; Page Timings report, and it&amp;rsquo;s a very useful feature for optimizing your website.
  However, there&amp;rsquo;s a murky underside to this generous feature. The way Page Timings collection works is that when Pageview hits are sent from the site, a sample of these (1% by default) are automatically followed by a timing hit which includes page performance data grabbed from the Navigation Timing API.</description>

      <description>Ever since the Lookup Table variable was introduced in Google Tag Manager, users have been craving for more. The Lookup Table does exactly what it promises: lookups. These are exact match operations, which are extremely inexpensive to perform, because they can only have a binary result: either the match exists in the data store being queried or it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. This performance stays constant even if the data store being queried increases in size.</description>

      <description>Last updated 20 April 2020: Clarified how lazy-loaded videos can be tracked with this trigger.
 Let&amp;rsquo;s cut straight to the chase. Google Tag Manager has just released the YouTube Video trigger, which gives you native support for YouTube video tracking. And it&amp;rsquo;s great! Even though we&amp;rsquo;ve been more than satisfied with the excellent tracking scripts provided by e.g. Cardinal Path and Bounteous (with a small modification from yours truly), this is a no-brainer for native support in Google Tag Manager.</description>

      <description>The steady increase in mobile use over the last years has introduced some new challenges for web analytics. It&amp;rsquo;s not just about mismatches in the tracking model (the concept of sessions is even more absurd for apps than it is for desktop browsing), but about something more fundamental, more basic. Think about it: if a visitor visits the website using a mobile device, there&amp;rsquo;s a significant chance of them losing internet connectivity and going unintentionally offline.</description>

      <description>More often than not, much of what we do in web analytics can be automated. This applies especially to implementations, audits, configurations, and reporting. So when I&amp;rsquo;m faced with a menial, manual task that might take hours for me to complete if done by hand, I always look at what could be done with some scripting and API work. I want to introduce a couple of Google Sheets add-ons I&amp;rsquo;ve written and released to the public.</description>

      <title>Google Analytics Settings Variable In GTM</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-analytics-settings-variable-in-gtm/</guid>
      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it - most of us use Google Tag Manager for one main purpose: to deploy and configure Google Analytics tracking on a website. I&amp;rsquo;d wager that once you start using GTM, you won&amp;rsquo;t be implementing Universal Analytics the old-fashioned way, with on-page code, any more. But running Universal Analytics tags through GTM isn&amp;rsquo;t yet a perfect workflow. We&amp;rsquo;re still missing things like proper plugin support and the option to properly differentiate between the tracker and the hit - both of which are easy to do with an on-page implementation.</description>

      <title>New Approval Workflow In GTM 360</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/new-approval-workflow-gtm-360/</guid>
      <description>Apart from the unlimited number of workspaces, the 360 Suite version of Google Tag Manager didn&amp;rsquo;t have any differentiation from the free version feature-wise, until today.
  GTM just introduced an approval workflow, which allows you to exercise some additional control over what changes are pushed to the live site, or created into versions.
Note that this update also introduced a small change in the regular GTM UI - mainly, the menu that used to have &amp;ldquo;Create Version&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Publish&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Preview&amp;rdquo; is now changed into a dual button layout with just Preview and Submit as the options.</description>

      <title>Track Autocomplete Search In Google Tag Manager</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 07:40:54 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-autocomplete-search-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>Autocomplete search is a tricky thing to track. The underlying logic is that when the user starts feeding characters into a search form, the search suggests results based on a limited input. If the user is not satisfied with the results, they can continue adding characters to the search, thus increasing the accuracy. Often there&amp;rsquo;s also the option to revert to a regular search with what they&amp;rsquo;ve already written. Tracking this logic in tools like Google Analytics is difficult, because there&amp;rsquo;s really no way to know if the search was successful.</description>

      <description>With the release of the latest Google Tag Manager API version, it&amp;rsquo;s time to release the new version of GTM Tools. Most of the changes have been done under the hood, with the entire codebase refactored for improved stability.
I released the first toolset in October 2014, and quickly released an updated UI a few months later. Aside from a few bug fixes and stability improvements, the tools have remained largely unchanged since then.</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager has a very nifty programmatic API that lets you do almost anything that&amp;rsquo;s also possible within the GTM UI. I&amp;rsquo;ve used the API a lot, most notably for my GTM Tools, which might be getting a new release soon, too!
The API was recently updated to its second release version (V2), and in this article I want to go over the additions, removals, and changes that the new version introduced.</description>

      <description>A couple of years ago I wrote an article on tracking interactions with the SoundCloud widget via Google Tag Manager. When a platform provides a JavaScript embed API, it&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly easy to track interactions with the player. You&amp;rsquo;ve seen this with YouTube, with SoundCloud, with JWPlayer, and now you&amp;rsquo;ll see how to do this with the Mixcloud player.
  If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Mixcloud is, well it&amp;rsquo;s a hugely popular streaming service for DJs, podcasts, radio shows, and other published radio media.</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager provides us with a bunch of handy triggers, designed to make capturing user interactions on the website much easier. These triggers are part of a paradigm called auto-event tracking, which comprises the Click, Form, History, and JavaScript Error trigger types.
  Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve covered GTM&amp;rsquo;s triggers many, many times before. If you need a refresher, take a look at the following articles:

      <description>One of the biggest fears I have as a Google Tag Manager user is a broken release of the website (or app) on which I have deployed GTM. Far too often, lack of proper communication practices within an organization lead to a release being pushed out without thoroughly testing how this release impacts any existing tracking solutions.
  Luckily there are ways to mitigate this. The most significant and impactful precautions you can take are all about process:</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/accelerated-mobile-pages-via-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>Google Tag Manager recently published support for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). This support comes in the form of a new Container type in Google Tag Manager.
  When you create an AMP container in GTM, you are actually setting up an external configuration for AMP, which leverages AMP&amp;rsquo;s own analytics module. As befits Google Tag Manager, creating the configuration is done in the familiar Google Tag Manager user interface, and you have (almost) all the tools of regular Google Tag Manager at your disposal.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/site-speed-sample-rate-multiple-page-views/</guid>
      <description>Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; Site Speed reports are pretty darn great. They report automatically on various milestones in the process the browser undertakes when rendering content. These reports leverage the Navigation Timing API of the web browser, and they are (typically) collected on the first Page View hit of a page.
And this is all fine. As I said, it&amp;rsquo;s a great feature of Google Analytics, and lends itself handily to spotting issues in the quite complex client-server negotiation that goes on when your web browser requests content from the web server.</description>

      <description>This is a guest post by Stephen Harris from Seer Interactive . He was kind enough to share his awesome solution in this blog, so I&amp;rsquo;m very grateful indeed for his contribution.
If Google Tag Manager is loaded as the primary instrument for tracking on a webpage (as it should be), then all webpage tracking could and should be configurable via GTM. But we don&amp;rsquo;t always control the circumstances, and it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to face hardcoded Google Analytics tracking outside of GTM.</description>

  This article expands on a conference talk I gave at MeasureCamp IX, London a short while ago. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been quite single-minded about the importance of JavaScript in web analytics development, and it was a pleasure for me to get some of that off my chest.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a crazy week. Just crazy. Not only did Google Tag Manager introduce Workspaces, arguably one of its most important releases ever for GTM, but they also revamped the user interface! So very big changes have been underfoot, and I&amp;rsquo;m so happy to be writing about them, because in my completely biased opinion these changes are amazing and well worth the long wait.
In this article, I want to quickly walk you through what I think are the most meaningful changes in the interface.</description>

Well GTM has taken a gigantic leap forward to soothe these concerns, with the release of its latest feature: WORKSPACES.</description>

      <description>Cross-domain tracking, in Google Analytics, is the process of passing information stored in browser cookies from one domain to another. Due to web browsers&amp;rsquo; same-origin policy, a browser cookie is only available to the domain it is written on and all its subdomains (by default). Since Google Analytics uses cookies to persist the Client ID, once the user moves from domain to domain it&amp;rsquo;s important to somehow pass this Client ID, too.</description>

      <description>Last updated 2 March 2018.
Every now and then you might be urged to run Google Tag Manager and/or Google Analytics locally, meaning without the benefit of a web server serving your files. In other words, you&amp;rsquo;re loading an HTML file from your computer in the web browser. You can identify a locally run file by the file:/// protocol in the address bar.
  Now, deploying Google Tag Manager onto that file with the hopes of running Google Analytics requests locally isn&amp;rsquo;t quite simple.</description>

      <description>Enhanced Ecommerce is a very useful set of reports in Google Analytics. They extend the standard Ecommerce funnel, which measures only purchases, and allow you to observe products from the very first impression, through various interactions, all the way to the purchase and even beyond, if the user wanted a refund. Google has some solid documentation on how to implement and interpret Enhanced Ecommerce, but if there&amp;rsquo;s one area that would deserve more illumination, it&amp;rsquo;s attribution.</description>

      <description>I have very little against Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; default dashboards. The reason I shy away from them is because they lack the type of customization I&amp;rsquo;ve come to expect from a dashboarding tool. On top of that, they only let you look at GA data, and I learned early on in my career that focusing on just one vertical is one of the cardinal sins you can make as an analyst.</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager is a great tool. Yeah, you came all the way to this article to read that truism. It also performs really well, loading at a sweet, swift pace even on a slow connection, thanks to pretty decent response times from Google servers. On top of that, the library itself loads asynchronously, meaning the container download doesn&amp;rsquo;t interrupt the browser as it tries to make sense of your messy HTML.</description>

      <title>Simple Tracker Duplication For Universal Analytics</title>

      <description>First of all, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry about the title. I should really stop throwing the word &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; around, since people always tell me that the stuff I claim to be easy and straightforward is rarely so. But since this is my blog, I reserve the right to use whatever stupid and misleading terminology I want. I maintain that what follows IS quite simple, especially when considering the amount of complexity it reduces in your Universal Analytics setup.</description>

So today, after my talk (joint session with the awesome Dave Sottimano), I was listening to the inimitable Mike King give an excellent presentation together with Ari Nahmani on technical skill prerequisites for all digital marketers today. Needless to say, I strongly agree with their view that digital marketing has always been a technical discipline, and the web is getting more and more complex each day that passes.</description>

      <title>Track Content Engagement Part 2</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-content-engagement-part-2/</guid>
      <description>A couple of days ago, I wrote an article on tracking content engagement. Even though the solution itself works, and it&amp;rsquo;s a really neat trick if I can say so myself, it has its problems.
After all the glory I showered on User Timings in Google Analytics, they have one serious flaw: they cap at 10,000 samples per day. What a ridiculous, arbitrary limit.
In any case, this means that if you have enough traffic to accumulate 10K user timing hits per day, it means that the solution I provided in the previous article will not work for you, as the Pageviews will not be capped, meaning the calculation of Total Engaged Time / Pageviews will be skewed.</description>

      <description>When looking at Google Analytics reports, you&amp;rsquo;d think you get a pretty good idea of how people are interacting with your site, right? I mean, you&amp;rsquo;re tracking events here, pageviews there, and user timings, custom dimensions, custom metrics, and calculated metrics are all part of your daily lingo. But you&amp;rsquo;re also probably aware of how futile this tracking is. After all, all you&amp;rsquo;re seeing are numbers that reflect certain outcomes the visitors have produced on the website, and how these outcomes match against your preconceived goals and objectives, right?</description>

      <description>This is a really cool feature for Google Analytics data collection, of which I&amp;rsquo;ve heard very, very little buzz. It&amp;rsquo;s a way to debug any and all hits sent to the Google Analytics endpoint at https://www.google-analytics.com/collect.
  In all simplicity, you just need to copy the entire URL of the HTTP request to your clipboard, paste it into a web browser, and add /debug between the hostname and /collect.</description>

      <description>In this article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to tackle one of the most frequently asked questions out there:
Can you run Google Analytics using the snippet AND using a Google Tag Manager Tag on the same page?
  There are many facets to this query, so I&amp;rsquo;ll try to tackle as many of them as I possibly can.
First, a terminology rant. You hear lots of talk about &amp;ldquo;on-page&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;inline&amp;rdquo; Google Analytics tracking, as that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s used to describe the non-GTM way of tracking Google Analytics.</description>

First things first, here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of me shovelling snow:
  And now back to the topic at hand.
One of the things that seems to be a hot topic in Universal Analytics is cross-domain tracking. I&amp;rsquo;ve never really tackled the beast head-on, since there&amp;rsquo;s such a wealth of excellent articles about it out there.</description>

      <title>Firing A Single Tag Multiple Times In GTM</title>

      <description>There might be many reasons you&amp;rsquo;d want to fire a single Tag multiple times in Google Tag Manager. The most common one is when you want to deploy multiples of a single tracking point on the web. Perhaps you have a roll-up account you want to send the hits to, in addition to the site-specific tracking property.
Quite a while ago, I gave a solution for this with a specific focus on Google Analytics Tags.</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager, our favorite free tag management solution, has always struggled with its enterprise-worthiness. There are many features still lacking, most of which have to do with working in multi-user environments. Now, grab the last word of that sentence (see what I did there), and hug it tightly, for GTM just introduced a new, enterprise-friendly feature: Environments.
  These Environments are actually browser cookies, which you use to link a Google Tag Manager container state with the browser of the user who needs to or wants to view that particular state.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve written about it many times before, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much why I want to keep on blogging and writing about analytics and tag management customizations. At eMetrics, I stepped out of my comfort zone of development and implementation, and chose to talk about organization practices.</description>

      <title>Iframe Cross-Domain Tracking In Google Tag Manager</title>

      <description>NOTE! This solution has been upgraded, and the new approach can be found here.
 If you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with the lingo, cross-domain tracking is a hack used by Google Analytics to circumvent the web browser&amp;rsquo;s same-origin policy. Essentially, the policy dictates that browser cookies can only be shared with a parent domain and all its sub-domains. In other words, domainA.com and domainB.com do not share cookies.
Since Google Analytics calculates sessions and users by using a cookie, this is problematic.</description>

Now, blocking ads and other intrusive content is nothing new, nor do I want to get into a debate about whether it&amp;rsquo;s a good thing or not. But as a data geek I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in knowing just what share of my site tracking has some content blocker enabled. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show two tricks (easy and advanced) to expose these content blockers.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s an interesting and hacky use case for you. It&amp;rsquo;s all about uncovering bounce metrics for visits which originate from organic Google search results. In particular, the metric we&amp;rsquo;re interested in is how long user dwelled on the landing page after arriving from organic Google search AND returned to the search engine results page (SERP) using the browser&amp;rsquo;s back button.
  The inspiration for this post came from an audience question at the Best Internet Conference in Lithuania, which I recently attended as a speaker.</description>

      <description>Enhanced Ecommerce is undoubtedly an excellent feature of Google Analytics. It provides us with a set of reports that truly extend the capabilities of funnel-based website analysis. As I&amp;rsquo;ve shown before, it&amp;rsquo;s also very useful for tracking other transactional events on your site, such as content engagement.
  However, here&amp;rsquo;s the thing. It&amp;rsquo;s not very easy to implement. Even if you get everything right according to the documentation, there are still quite a number of pitfalls, and many of the learnings emerge only through experience.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s called Tag sequencing, and its purpose is to facilitate the sequential firing of Tags. The idea is that you can specify a setup and a cleanup for each Tag in your container.

      <description>The web is stateless. It&amp;rsquo;s basically blind to your past, and it does a poor job of predicting what you might do in the future. When you browse to a website, the browser requests the page from the web server, and then proceeds to render it for you. This is a detached, clinical process, and any personalized or stateful data transfer is left to the sophistication of your web server.</description>

In this short tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to track the time users spend on your form fields.

With small modifications, you can expand the script to cover multiple forms on a page.</description>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-form-abandonment-with-google-tag-manager/</guid>
      <description>Form abandonment isn&amp;rsquo;t always easy to define. Most often, it refers to when someone starts to fill in an HTML form, but leaves the page without submitting it. As a definition, this works nicely. However, with multi-page forms it naturally refers only to the last page of the form. Also, especially with government institutions, forms can be saved to be submitted later. Here, again, form abandonment must be reconsidered.
  In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll go over four different ways to track form abandonment in Google Analytics, using Google Tag Manager to setup the tracking.</description>

The two features I want to introduce here are Folders in the UI, and code syntax highlighting in Custom HTML Tags and Custom JavaScript Variables.
Folders   Folders is one of those features that has been requested for over and over again since day one. The UI clutter in GTM is a serious problem, especially when dealing with dozens and dozens of items in a single view.</description>

      <description>One of the glaring omissions in the Enhanced Ecommerce reports of Universal Analytics is the ability to calculate cart value for products. Cart value, here, is the value that has been added to the cart.
This value can be used to query for products that have the highest discrepancy between cart value and generated revenue. These are missed opportunities of the highest caliber.
With some Custom Metrics magic, we can, however, get cart value into our reports, and we can find our most and least &amp;ldquo;effective&amp;rdquo; products with just a glance:</description>

      <description>Enhanced Ecommerce is a very nice improvement to the pretty lame, transaction-based Ecommerce tracking in Universal Analytics. Instead of staring blindly at what happens on a receipt page, Enhanced Ecommerce expands your entire webstore into one large funnel labelled &amp;ldquo;Shopping Behavior&amp;rdquo;, and you&amp;rsquo;re able to zoom in on the Checkout funnel as well. Also, the addition of product-scoped tracking is incredibly useful, and it&amp;rsquo;s enabled us to think of any asset (our content, for example) on our site as something we could track through the Enhanced Ecommerce reports.</description>

  There it is. Clear as day: &amp;ldquo;Tracking users across subdomains does not require any additional configuration.&amp;rdquo; Also, some of the recent, excellent guides to cross-domain tracking, written by E-Nor and Bounteous enforce the same: you just need a default Universal Analytics Tag in Google Tag Manager.</description>

For artists, it&amp;rsquo;s a channel for distributing previews of their tracks, and for people like me it&amp;rsquo;s a nice way to do some API tinkering. To each their own, I guess!
  I saw a number of requests in the Google+ Google Tag Manager community about a SoundCloud integration, so I decided to look into it to see if I could just build one.</description>

      <description>Data is difficult. Growing a business is difficult. Measuring success is difficult. And you know what? They should be difficult. Otherwise we&amp;rsquo;d all be equally stupid, whereas now those of us ambitious enough to exert themselves are winning the race.
  And it&amp;rsquo;s not just working with data that&amp;rsquo;s difficult. The whole Web is a mess! Search engine optimization consultants, for example, are trigger-happy in doling out advice about server-side redirects without stopping to consider the implications of what they&amp;rsquo;re recommending.</description>

      <description>Last weekend, I wrote a very simple web app that automatically creates a number of referral spam filters to tackle the problem that seems to have everybody all riled up.
  For a nice recap of the situation, take a look at this post by Jeff Sauer, or this article by Mike Sullivan.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t an opinion piece, even though I&amp;rsquo;ve got a great number of opinions about this issue.</description>

      <description>There are many tools and methods to make Google Analytics more manageable. Google Tag Manager is probably the best known of these, and you can find many, many articles about GTM on these pages as well.
However, today I want to tell you about one of the features of Universal Analytics that hasn&amp;rsquo;t, as far as I know, received too much attention. It&amp;rsquo;s funny, because at the same time almost everyone uses the feature in the shape of eCommerce, enhanced link attribution, and cross-domain tracking.</description>

      <description>If you read my previous post on fetching the Client ID from the Universal Analytics tracker object with Google Tag Manager, you might have agreed with me that it sucks you can&amp;rsquo;t access the tracker object interface in real time using Google Tag Manager. This is because all of the set commands you add to a Universal Analytics tag template take place before the analytics.js is loaded and the tracker object is properly created.</description>

      <description>Since writing my rant about the schema conspiracy of web analytics platforms, I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving the whole idea of hit-level data collection a lot of thought. Sessionization is very heavily implemented in Google Analytics, which is understandable, but the regular Google Analytics API just doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you the kind of information you&amp;rsquo;d need, if you wanted to stitch hits together differently in your own backend. In fact, there are four distinct levels of aggregation that are not exposed via the API, even though I think they should:</description>

      <description>In 2013, I wrote a guide for Universal Analytics and Google Tag Manager on how to poll for weather conditions, and send this information to Google Analytics as a custom dimension of the session. The guide was intended as a technical introduction to Google Tag Manager, and I think it succeeded in that.
However, GTM has changed a lot over the last 1.5 years, and I&amp;rsquo;ve made some improvements to the method along the way.</description>

      <description>A schema is something that data processing platforms such as Google Analytics apply to the raw hit data coming in from the data source (usually a website). The most visible aspect of Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; schema is how it groups, or stitches, the arbitrary, hit-level data coming in from the website into discrete sessions, and these are actually grouped under yet another aggregate bucket: users.
But you already know this. You&amp;rsquo;re looking at metrics like Sessions, Bounce Rate, Conversion Rate, and you&amp;rsquo;re using them or variations of them as KPIs in your dashboards and whatnot.</description>

  A new Google Tag Manager feature, published at 02:07 AM my time, and with an easter egg hunt involved?! Of course it was the infuriating Charles Farina who found the new feature and claimed the prize. Curses! (Just kidding Charles, you&amp;rsquo;re still awesome.)

      <description>This nifty little solution will let you calculate the time spent on pages that are not tracked in Google Analytics by default. These include both bounced landing pages and exit pages. Bounced pages and exit pages lack the necessary subsequent pageview, which Google Analytics uses to calculate time-based metrics.

      <description>One of the big mysteries in browser-based data collection platforms like Google Analytics is what happens when the visitor is not being tracked. This is most obvious in cases where the user explicitly opts out of tracking, when the user does not have JavaScript active in their browser, in bounced sessions, and on exit pages.
Opt-outing means that the user explicitly prohibits a website from tracking them. In some cases, it&amp;rsquo;s possible that opt-out is the default, and the user must explicitly opt-in to allow GA to record their visits.</description>

So, the time has come to update my GTM Tools. I released the first toolset in October 2014, and it performed its duties just well enough. Sure, the UI was ugly as hell, and there were bugs along the way, but for cloning containers, macros, and rules, and for visualizing containers, it was just good enough.</description>

      <description>Google has a myriad of ways to make the search engine results page (SERP) livelier. When you input a search query, the engine&amp;rsquo;s mission is to provide you with the most relevant information with as few clicks as possible. Often, this means that you&amp;rsquo;ll see the answer to your query directly in the SERP:

      <description>(Updated 21 February 2019)
The current version of Google Tag Manager was released in October 2014. With the release, we saw a brand-spanking new UI, a lot of new functionalities (revamped auto-event tracking, for example), plus a new terminology to cope with. We moved away from the programming-centric concepts of Macros and Rules to the more tactile variables and triggers.
It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to rank the changes. The new Auto-Event Tracking is perhaps most impactful, but the improvements done to triggers and variables, when compared to the previous version of GTM, require attention as well.</description>

In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the steps I went to implement the solution, along with examples of the data I can now access through Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; reporting interface. As you might have guessed, if you&amp;rsquo;ve read my articles before, I implemented Enhanced Ecommerce with Google Tag Manager.</description>

      <description>Updated 27 March 2019
 In the new version of Google Tag Manager, one of the most visible and profound changes to the previous version is how tags are fired (and blocked). First of all, there&amp;rsquo;s the obvious terminological distinction: we talk about triggers now, not rules. Second, triggers have become an integral part of the tag creation workflow, and as such have far more significance in the user interface than before.</description>

      <description>One of the recurring problems in migrating to Google Tag Manager is how to make the transition as smooth as possible. Usually it requires that we agree with the developers on a time when the old code is removed, and at that moment we need to make sure the GTM tags point to the right UA code. This is, of course, only one use case for migrations, as some people do the entire migration in a staging environment, and some just don&amp;rsquo;t care if they lose a little bit of data along the way.</description>

      <description>When our good friends in the Google Tag Manager developer team first introduced the Lookup Table Macro, we were excited. For many of us, it soon became the weapon of choice especially when used as a management and optimization tool for the container itself.
  However, the macro wasn&amp;rsquo;t considered perfect. In fact, the most frequently heard request had to do with the core functionality of the feature itself: the macro should support operations, that is, predicate logic.</description>

      <description>If you use Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, or any JavaScript-based data collection or analytics platform, have you ever stopped to wonder how they actually work? I mean, you obviously care about getting the data in, but are you taking the machinations of these tools for granted?
This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about for a long while, because I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure that many who work with these platforms actually understand how the browser and the web page interact.</description>

      <description>In the new version of Google Tag Manager, auto-event tracking has received a considerable usability upgrade. It might seem quirky at first, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re used to the old auto-event tracking method, but the logic behind the new setup is brilliant.
  The most important distinction is that auto-event tracking isn&amp;rsquo;t something you control with separate tags anymore. Rather, it&amp;rsquo;s now entirely trigger-driven, meaning you activate and specify the auto-event tracking of your choice using tag triggers (triggers are what ye olde folk used to call rules).</description>

Well, I just yesterday published the first of my GTM API tools (the Container Visualizer), and I vowed that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t release the other tools for a number of reasons.
The reasons were good, in my opinion (especially the part about the tools being ugly as crap), but on the other hand I don&amp;rsquo;t want to keep anyone away from the amazing potential of the new API.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that setting up eCommerce in Google Tag Manager (and now the new Enhanced ecommerce) is very difficult for many. I&amp;rsquo;m sure part of the problem is that eCommerce is for many users the moment that GTM forces you to take steps in to the developer&amp;rsquo;s domain, since it&amp;rsquo;s obvious that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to add some code to the web page.

As before, I want to write an accompanying post for my session, since there&amp;rsquo;s always so much more to say than the time slot allows for. So, the topic of this article is the data model used by Google Tag Manager to process digital data in your data layer.
This post also picks up where I left in my previous foray into the data layer. However, where the first article aimed to be generic (since the data layer should be generic), this post will look at how GTM uses the information in the generic data layer, and how it processes this information to work with the proprietary features of the tool.</description>

      <description>The Page Visibility API for web browsers is pretty sweet. It lets you poll, using some new properties of the document object, whether or not the current page is visible to the user. Visibility is hidden if the page is not open in the current browser tab instance, or if the browser window has been minimized.
  In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll give an example of how features of the Page Visibility API could be used with Google Tag Manager.</description>

If you know your JavaScript, you know that all variables, functions, objects, resources, and data in the document get rewritten with every page load. In other words, every single page refresh builds the page from scratch, and the state of the document before the page refresh is left drifting in the ocean of oblivion.

Behind this tragically boring title is a simple solution to many problems with Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s auto-event tracking. The common denominator to these problems is poor website markup. Selectors are used sparingly, and element hierarchy is messy. This disregard for proper node relationships means you have to resort to Data Layer Variable Macros which look like</description>

That means that you&amp;rsquo;ll have to test your custom listener in a live container (I know, ouch!). If you want to test in Debug Mode, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to skip using the {{generic event handler}} as a macro, and instead copy the inner function into the Custom HTML Tag, give the function a name, and use that as the callback in addEventListener or attachEvent.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been an awesome summer, with temperatures soaring in the global warming range throughout our northern country. The heat has given me ample reason to not be near a computer, but now it&amp;rsquo;s time to mine some JavaScript wisdom again. Here&amp;rsquo;s the second part of my JavaScript for Google Tag Manager series. The first part focused on GTM specific tips and tricks, and I hope that while reading it, you were treated to another grand example of the flexibility of this wonderful tool.</description>

      <title>Internalize for Google Analytics v1.0</title>

      <guid>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/internalize-google-analytics-v1-0/</guid>
      <description>I created a new Chrome Extension: Internalize for Google Analytics. This is its very first version. It only works on websites with Universal Analytics.
Click here to download Internalize for Google Analytics v1.0
The idea is that with the extension you can push a custom dimension value to your currently active session. You can then use a profile filter in GA to block traffic with this custom dimension value. It&amp;rsquo;s useful when blocking internal traffic with more traditional means (IP address or various GTM workarounds) won&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

      <description>Analyzing what people write in your site search field is pretty much one of the smartest things you can do for your website tracking. If certain terms pop up over and over again in internal search reports, it means that your site is not providing the answers people are looking for, meaning you have an excellent opportunity to provide supply for the demand!
  However, not all site search applications are trackable out-of-the-box.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the link to part 2 of this JavaScript guide.
The thing about Google Tag Manager, or any JavaScript tag manager for that matter, is that there&amp;rsquo;s JavaScript involved. In fact, the tool itself is just a JavaScript library with some additional bells and whistles (such as a management UI). This means that to make the best of it, some knowledge of JavaScript is warranted, and that&amp;rsquo;s the point of this post.</description>

      <description>Apologies for leaving you hanging. It&amp;rsquo;s now almost three weeks since I published the first part of this post, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve been holding your breath ever since.
There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot going on since the last post. First, my favorite sports team in the world, San Antonio Spurs, won their fifth NBA championship from the defending champs, Miami Heat. Next, my wife and I moved to our new house, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been remodeling ever since.</description>

Some of these are macro magic through and through, some of these are best practices, and some of these are things that will make your life easier while managing a tag management solution.

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s right, I changed the name! Huge thanks to Paul Gailey for the inspiration.
Get the latest version of GTM Sonar here.
Just a minor update this time. I added some informative text to the pop-up, along with an error screen if something goes wrong.
  Another change is that now when an element is added to debugDL, a counter on the Browser Action icon will start climbing, representing the number of objects in the array.</description>

I updated my Chrome Extension, GTM Auto-Event Listener Debugger v1.1. I released the first version a couple of days ago. The extension can be used to debug Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s auto-event tracking and its compatibility with web page markup.
Download the latest version here.
I did some major changes, and here&amp;rsquo;s the rundown.
  I transferred all debugger actions into a pop-up, which opens when you click the Browser Action.</description>

      <description>(Last updated June 2014: Read the latest post on the extension, GTM Sonar v1.2.)
Many of the Google Tag Manager articles on this blog could be considered hacks, in that they extend the out-of-the-box features of GTM in ways that will surely not be officially supported by Google. The crux of the problem is that lots of folks are taken by surprise when GTM refuses to work properly on their site, or when they have trouble tracking key elements on the page template.</description>

      <description>Over the last couple of posts I&amp;rsquo;ve mainly been doing proof-of-concept (POC) tests with Google Tag Manager. The great thing about a POC is that you don&amp;rsquo;t really need to have any viable results or insight-driving technological innovations. The point is to showcase some feature of the platform on which the experiment was conducted.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll take a care-free step into the world of POCs again. My goal is to do a simple split test in order to identify which variant of a landing page (or key element thereof) produces the most conversions.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to set up a rudimentary email alert system in your Google Tag Manager implementation. Say, for example, you want to receive an email every time an uncaught error occurs on your website. It&amp;rsquo;s not a very good use case, since a large website can spawn hundreds of uncaught exceptions in a short period of time, but let&amp;rsquo;s just pretend for now.
If you know your JavaScript, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that you can&amp;rsquo;t send mail using client-side code.</description>

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through a tutorial on how to create a Google Tag Manager extension. This extension will be a new listener, whose sole job is to listen for changes in the HTML and CSS markup on the page.
The reason I&amp;rsquo;m teaching you how to create a DOM listener is simple. Ever so often I come across people asking for help, but they are unable to touch on-page code.</description>

      <description>If you know your Google Tag Manager, you know that GTM pushes three data layer events into the queue when any page with the container snippet is rendered. Each of these three events signals a specific stage in the page load process. Here are the events (be sure to read my guide on GTM rules to understand further what these events do):
  gtm.js - This is pushed into the data layer as soon as GTM is initialized and the container is loaded.</description>

You see, in an undisclosed number of hours after the publishing of this blog post, I will be talking at the MeasureCamp unconference on this very subject. Or, I hope I will. The whole unconference thing is somewhat confusing, and it involves lighting-fast reflexes and street smarts for slot selection; traits which I sadly lack.</description>

      <description>First of all, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for the wacky title. Sometimes I just want to amuse myself. Nevertheless, this post is about the Google Tag Manager container snippet. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing secretive about it, but I&amp;rsquo;m betting many people have no clue what the snippet really does. That&amp;rsquo;s the revelatory part.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve never wondered what the snippet does, then shame on you! Remember, you own your page template. It&amp;rsquo;s yours. Any code that you write there is your responsibility.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably come across a number of guides or posts talking about why it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to block so-called internal traffic from your web analytics reports. The reasons are pretty solid: internal traffic does not emulate normal visitor behavior, it rarely contributes to conversions (skewing up your conversion rate), it inflates page views, and it wreaks havoc on your granular, page-by-page data.
Internal traffic is vaguely described as &amp;ldquo;your employees&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;people really close to your brand&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;your marketing department&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;your web editors&amp;rdquo;, and so on.</description>

      <description>Because I was bored, I did a quick test to sort out the firing order of competing GTM listeners. If you&amp;rsquo;ve done your homework (i.e. read my article on GTM listeners), you&amp;rsquo;ll remember that GTM listeners are set up on the document node of the document object model (DOM). I wanted to test what the firing order is if you have multiple competing listeners on the same page.
I tested with the following listeners (make sure you read up on auto-event tracking if you are completely baffled at this point):</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new listener in town! It&amp;rsquo;s a few days now since the Google Tag Manager team unleashed the History Listener, and the time has come for me to tell you what this baby can do.
The History Listener is designed to be used on websites where content is loaded dynamically. Typically, these websites make heavy use of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), which is designed for loading content in the background and serving it dynamically without having to reload the page.</description>

      <description>There is a new version of this guide for GTM V2 here.
(Last updated April 2014) I see Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s operational model as an analogy of Montesquieu&amp;rsquo;s three-branched government theory (don&amp;rsquo;t leave just yet, I&amp;rsquo;m getting somewhere with this). We have the legislative power of tags (what should be done), the judiciary power of macros (explore the context and circumstance of each tag), and the executive power of rules (make the tag happen).</description>

Relief of IT department bottlenecks – once the Tag Manager is deployed, new tags can be implemented directly by Marketing with no IT department involvement. This is a huge benefit for large websites, where IT is oftentimes a bottleneck. Original text here
 IT Issues - when you use a TMS like &#39;Google Tag Manager&#39; you are bypassing the IT department.</description>

There may be many reasons why your listeners don&amp;rsquo;t work, but a very common trend is that you have conflicting JavaScript libraries or scripts running on your page.
Let&amp;rsquo;s explore how listeners work before tackling the problem.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written a new Variable Guide for Google Tag Manager, which covers the new GTM UI. This guide is for the old UI.
You might be vaguely familiar with macros if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever used a computer. Basically, whenever you perform a complicated task with a simple gesture, or reuse complex code with a simple input mechanism, you&amp;rsquo;re using macros. Think keyboard shortcuts.
In Google Tag Manager, this is the essence of macros.</description>

      <description>Content Grouping is a nice new feature from the good folks at Google Analytics. Basically, it allows you to group your content according to a logical structure. You can create up to five Content Groupings, and you can have as many Content Groups within these groupings as you like. The difference between a Content Grouping and Content Group is hierarchy. The second is a member of the first. Read Justin Cutroni&amp;rsquo;s post on Content Groupings to get you started.</description>

      <description>Have you ever stopped to think about what the chain of events was that led you to a particular decision? Maybe not, but in web analytics it is something that should be considered. After all, there is something counter-intuitive about analytics tools such as Google Analytics, which require us to think in terms of clicks and recorded events that occur on the website, during the visit.
Thankfully, we have evolved as a species, and we no longer place too much emphasis on last click attribution.</description>

      <description>(Last updated March 2014) This post is the final chapter of a trilogy. The ultimate refinement, if you will. It all started with my foray into the murky waters of context, when I tested how weather data could be used to provide extra information about site visits. When I wrote that post, I had two trepidations: 1) does sending the API call with every single page view affect site performance negatively, and 2) does forcing the page view call to wait for the API call to complete affect the quality of visit metrics.</description>

      <description>There is a new version of this post for GTM V2 here.
While going over my previous post about using weather conditions to segment data in Google Analytics, I started thinking about performance issues. Since I&amp;rsquo;m using a visit-scope custom dimension, it seems futile to have it send the weather details with every single page load. The odds of the weather changing drastically during one visit are slim (unless you live in the UK), and I have yet to come up with a good reason to change my on-site behavior because the weather changed from a drizzle to a downpour.</description>

      <description>(Last updated June 2014) Google Analytics provides us with a nifty way of tracking social interactions. With a simple plugin, you can track how many +1s and Likes your pages accumulate.
This guide shows you how to activate social interaction tagging with Google Tag Manager and Universal Analytics. The instructions are for Facebook Likes, Google+ +1s (now deprecated since Google Analytics tracks +1s automatically), Twitter Tweets and Pinterest Pins.
Note that if you use a third-party API (e.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 9 Oct 2013 - This works in Google Spreadsheets now as well! Feel free to make a copy of the sheet and work with the code. It&amp;rsquo;s still just a prototype, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to see data bouncing from spreadsheets to Google Analytics.

ORIGINAL POST Inspired by Daniel Waisberg&amp;rsquo;s excellent post detailing the use of Google Web Forms to send data to your Analytics account, I decided to create something similar.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had such a blast in the Google+ Google Analytics community. Not only are the people super-duper-nice, but I have the wonderful opportunity of helping people with their Google Analytics problems without feeling obligated to invoice them or ask for compensation for my troubles. I do it because I love to help, because I feel like I have a lot to share with the community, and because I&amp;rsquo;ve always believed that the more knowledge you share the more you accumulate.</description>

      <description>There is a new version of this post for GTM V2 here.
The Google Analytics Summit came and went, and thanks to the Live Stream, everyone could participate. We were treated to a rapid-fire selection of Google Analytics&amp;rsquo; new features, and this post sheds light on one of these in particular: automated event tracking in Google Tag Manager.
Auto-event tracking introduces a nice feature, which does what tag managers ought to do: it provides functionality without HTML template editing.</description>

      <title>Track Adjusted Bounce Rate In Universal Analytics</title>

      <description>So here we are again. Universal Analytics and Google Tag Manager, the dynamic duo, ready to strike again.
First, remember to check my previous two tips for UA and GTM use in custom scenarios:
 Weather as a custom dimension Tracking page load time  In this post, I visit the idea of adjusted bounce rate, which I came across a year ago in the Google Analytics blog.
Adjusted bounce rate basically refers to tweaking the traditional bounce rate collection method (single engagement hits / total visits) so that visits which only included a single page view would not count towards a bounce, as long as they met some qualitative requirements.</description>

      <title>Page Load Time In Universal Analytics</title>
      <link>https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/page-load-time-universal-analytics/</link>

      <description>In Google Analytics, you can monitor your site speed and get a decent overview of what pages are contributing positively and negatively to site speed. The problem with page load time metric is that it&amp;rsquo;s an average based on a sample. You can modify the sample rate with setSiteSpeedSampleRate(), but for me that&amp;rsquo;s not bloody well good enough.
(UPDATE 28.3.2014: This post is still valid, but an implementation with User Timings is a much smarter way to measure actual page load time.</description>
