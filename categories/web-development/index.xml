And when I refer to &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;their work&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>, I mean they have to proactively identify and exploit any loopholes they can find to keep on collecting their precious data.&lt;/p>

This time, I get to work with an old colleague of mine who&amp;rsquo;s a veritable wizard when it comes to building solutions that make our daily work in the digital industry so much smoother.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Erik Grönroos&lt;/strong> works as an analyst in &lt;a href="https://markkinointiakatemia.fi/">MarkkinointiAkatemia&lt;/a>, a Finnish digital customer acquisition agency. Erik&amp;rsquo;s job is to utilize data and analytics to help grow the agency as well as the companies of the clients he works with.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Static Site Search With Hugo + App Engine + Search API + Python</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/web-development/static-site-search-google-app-engine-search-api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 09:39:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/web-development/static-site-search-google-app-engine-search-api/</guid><description>&lt;p>As the year changed to 2018, I decided to abandon &lt;a href="https://www.wordpress.org">WordPress&lt;/a>, which I had been using for over 12 years as my content management system of choice. I had many reasons to do so, but the biggest motivators were the opportunity to try something new and to abandon the bloat and clutter of WordPress for a more simple, more elegant order of things. Spurred on by another adopter, &lt;a href="http://markedmondson.me/">Mark Edmondson&lt;/a>, I decided to give &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> a go (pun intended).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Universal Analytics: Weather As A Custom Dimension</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/web-development/universal-analytics-weather-custom-dimension/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2013 16:51:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/web-development/universal-analytics-weather-custom-dimension/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>There is a new version of this post for GTM V2 &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/send-weather-data-to-google-analytics-in-gtm-v2/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[Last updated June 2014] I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen in love with &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2790010?hl=en">Universal Analytics&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/tagmanager/">Google Tag Manager&lt;/a>. Together they form an incredibly powerful tool for marketing professionals. In most cases, I no longer need to post recommendations to my client for yet another page template revision, since with the tag manager in place, I can just add custom code via the admin panel. Add to that the power of Universal Analytics with its ultra-sensitive Measurement Protocol, and the ability to craft custom dimensions and metrics, and voila! I&amp;rsquo;m in a happy place.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
