      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a fabled, mythical beast that prowls the jungles of digital marketing. They have no issues with running and analyzing crawler data, offering suggestions for server-side redirects, building remarketing audiences, implementing tag management solutions, speaking of Data Layers, copy-pasting code from Stack Overflow, configuring bid managers, and speaking at conferences presenting on all the aforementioned activities. However, for some reason, they still claim that they are &amp;ldquo;non-technical&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;just marketers&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Dear client, search engine
Optimization for you?
Or perhaps - donuts?
The Web, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid,
Is a pretty sticky maze.
And you&amp;rsquo;re the trapped fly.
We tell you we&amp;rsquo;ll help,
But you will not believe us.
You are very wise.
Everything we do,
Everything we claim we do,
You can do yourself.
But if you let us
Approach you humbly, gently,
As a team, we&amp;rsquo;ll rock.
We&amp;rsquo;ll rock Google, check!</description>

      <title>It&#39;s Not About Marketing</title>

      <description>In a recent post, I took a short foray into the world of clumsy analogies by comparing the team work qualities (and necessities) of basketball and digital marketing. In an even earlier post, I made the claim that the single most important facet of content strategy is audience design. Well, now is the time to pull these two threads together all trilogy-like. After this, you can hail me as the Stieg Larsson of marketing.</description>

      <title>How Is Digital Marketing Like Basketball?</title>

      <description>So I was watching the 2013 NBA Eastern Conference Finals game 7 between Miami Heat and Indiana Pacers. While making note of the dozens of different ways that the lackluster Pacers were taken to the cleaners by the dominant Miami team (read: LeBron James), I started churning a funky thought in my head. This beautiful, wonderful, exciting, adrenaline-pumping, superstar-studded, tattoo-galore of a game must be an analogy of something. Something equally thought-provoking, exhilarating and life-changing.</description>
