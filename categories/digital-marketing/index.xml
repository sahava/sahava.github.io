They have no issues with running and analyzing crawler data, offering suggestions for server-side redirects, building remarketing audiences, implementing tag management solutions, speaking of Data Layers, copy-pasting code from Stack Overflow, configuring bid managers, and speaking at conferences presenting on all the aforementioned activities. However, for some reason, they still claim that they are &amp;ldquo;non-technical&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;just marketers&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An Optimized Haiku</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/digital-marketing/an-optimized-haiku/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2013 18:23:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/digital-marketing/an-optimized-haiku/</guid><description>&lt;p>Dear client, search engine&lt;br>
Optimization for you?&lt;br>
Or perhaps - donuts?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Web, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid,&lt;br>
Is a pretty sticky maze.&lt;br>
And you&amp;rsquo;re the trapped fly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We tell you we&amp;rsquo;ll help,&lt;br>
But you will not believe us.&lt;br>
You are very wise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everything we do,&lt;br>
Everything we claim we do,&lt;br>
You can do yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But if you let us&lt;br>
Approach you humbly, gently,&lt;br>
As a team, we&amp;rsquo;ll rock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll rock Google, check!&lt;br>
We&amp;rsquo;ll rock the blogosphere, check!&lt;br>
We&amp;rsquo;ll rock Bing! (Who cares?)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>It's Not About Marketing</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/digital-marketing/its-not-about-marketing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2013 17:46:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/digital-marketing/its-not-about-marketing/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a recent post, I took a short foray into the world of clumsy analogies by comparing the team work qualities (and necessities) of &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/digital-marketing/how-is-digital-marketing-like-basketball/">basketball and digital marketing&lt;/a>. In an even earlier post, I made the claim that the single most important facet of &lt;a href="https://www.simoahava.com/seo/content-strategy-know-your-audience/">content strategy is audience design&lt;/a>. Well, now is the time to pull these two threads together all trilogy-like. After this, you can hail me as the &lt;a href="http://www.stieglarsson.com/">Stieg Larsson&lt;/a> of marketing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Is Digital Marketing Like Basketball?</title><link>https://www.simoahava.com/digital-marketing/how-is-digital-marketing-like-basketball/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2013 15:26:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.simoahava.com/digital-marketing/how-is-digital-marketing-like-basketball/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I was watching the 2013 NBA Eastern Conference Finals game 7 between Miami Heat and Indiana Pacers. While making note of the dozens of different ways that the lackluster Pacers were &lt;a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/miami-tops-upstart-indiana-pacers-game-7-earning-033337361.html">taken to the cleaners&lt;/a> by the dominant Miami team (read: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAUMJTv0s9g">LeBron James&lt;/a>), I started churning a funky thought in my head. This beautiful, wonderful, exciting, adrenaline-pumping, superstar-studded, tattoo-galore of a game &lt;strong>must&lt;/strong> be an analogy of something. Something equally thought-provoking, exhilarating and life-changing. Oh! I know! &lt;strong>Digital marketing&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
